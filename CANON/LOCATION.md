# Location Profile

## The Hostel

**Name:** Casa Colonial Los Muertos (Colonial House of the Dead - named for the street, not a warning)
**Type:** Heritage/Historic Budget
**Star Rating:** 2 (unrated officially, self-described as "historic boutique")
**Price Range:** $12-25 per night

### History
Built in 1624 as a merchant's house during Spanish colonial rule. Used as a hospital during independence wars (1810s). Converted to apartments in 1920s, to hostel in 2009. Never properly renovated - owner markets "original features" as selling point. Heritage wing is original 1624 construction, rest is 1920s addition.

### Architecture
- **Style:** Spanish Colonial - thick adobe walls, wooden beams, interior courtyard
- **Floors:** 2 (ground floor common areas, upper floor dormitories)
- **Total beds:** 32 beds across 6 rooms
- **Notable features:** Original 17th-century beams in heritage wing, interior courtyard with fountain (broken), hand-carved wooden balustrades

### The Death Location (Specific)
**Heritage Wing, Upper Floor, Room "Historia" (4-bed dorm)**

A 20x15 foot room featuring:
- Original 1624 wooden beams (termite-damaged)
- Adobe walls (rain-softened)
- Four metal bunk beds (added 2009)
- Original wooden shutters (rotted, won't close properly)
- Visible ceiling cracks (described as "character")
- Mosquito nets over beds (will entangle Emma)
- One bare bulb for lighting
- Floor slants noticeably toward exterior wall

The structural compromise:
- Main beam has 40% termite damage (internal, invisible from below)
- Load-bearing section of adobe wall crumbling
- No repairs since conversion to hostel
- Building inspector noted issues; was bribed
- Room was closed for 6 months, quietly reopened when money tight

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Carlos Mendoza
**Description:** 45, owner's nephew, handles day-to-day operations, knows the building is dangerous, hates himself for not doing more
**Role in death:** Warning-giver (attempted) - offered Emma a different room twice, was refused

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Marta | 60, local, refuses to clean heritage wing, crosses herself when passing |
| Security | None | N/A |
| Bar/Kitchen | None | Self-serve |
| Manager/Owner | Ricardo Orozco | 55, absentee, lives in Bogota, makes decisions remotely, prioritizes profit |

### Staff Knowledge
Carlos has begged his uncle to close the heritage wing. Marta knows the building is "malo" - bad - and has seen the cracks widen. Local workers avoid the heritage wing. There was a partial collapse three years ago (no injuries, covered up). Carlos was told to keep booking the rooms.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Slow, heat-soaked. Guests in hammocks, drinking juice, planning excursions to islands or the walled city. The building feels charming in daylight - you can ignore the danger.

### Night Vibe
Pre-game drinks on the courtyard. Groups heading out to salsa clubs. Quieter than most hostels - this attracts the "cultural" crowd, not party animals. By midnight, mostly silent except the creak of the building.

### Guest Demographics
- 40% gap year students (18-22)
- 25% older backpackers on South America circuit (25-35)
- 20% couples seeking "authentic" experience
- 15% solo travelers writing novels/finding themselves

### Reputation
**TripAdvisor:** 3.8 stars - "Charming but crumbling"
**Hostelworld:** 7.2 - "Beautiful but dated - heritage wing has issues"
**Word of mouth:** "Stay in the newer section unless you want an adventure"

## Practical Details

### Getting There
Bus from Cartagena bus terminal + taxi, or walk from walled city (30 min). Outside the main tourist area, technically in Getsemani.

### Check-in Process
Passport copy, cash preferred (card reader "broken"), brief tour, specific warning about heritage wing phrased as "it's more rustic"

### Rules
1. Quiet after midnight
2. No outside guests
3. Clean your dishes
4. **Heritage wing guests must sign waiver** (CRITICALLY RELEVANT - Emma signed without reading)

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: terrible inside, okay in courtyard)
- [x] Kitchen (basic, shared)
- [x] Lockers (small, rusty)
- [x] Laundry (hand wash only)
- [ ] Pool
- [ ] Bar
- [x] Rooftop (technically - access from 1920s section only, dangerous)
- [x] Tours offered (commission basis)
- [x] Other: Book exchange, hammocks, courtyard

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- Colonial building collapses have occurred in Cartagena (research specific cases)
- Hurricane season runs June-November
- Building codes in historic districts often less enforced to preserve "heritage"
- Termite damage common in tropical colonial wooden structures

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Colombia is not just drugs and danger - show the beauty too
- Colombian people are not negligent - frame as systemic/economic
- Acknowledge the complicated legacy of colonialism
- Don't mock Colombian Spanish or culture

### Sources
- Cartagena building code documentation
- News reports on structural failures in Latin American colonial buildings
- UNESCO World Heritage Site requirements vs. reality
- Colombian hurricane/tropical storm data
