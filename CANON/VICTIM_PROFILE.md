# Victim Profile

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Emma Lucinda Hartwell
**Nickname/Handle:** @EmmaTakesAYear
**Age:** 19
**Nationality:** British (Surrey)
**Occupation:** Gap year student (deferred Cambridge admission)

## Archetype
**Primary:** Gap Year Kid

**Secondary traits:**
- Overachiever taking a "break"
- Secretly terrified of the real world
- Desperate to seem more worldly than she is

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Naivety

**How it manifests:**
- Trusts that "old" equals "charming" rather than "dangerous"
- Believes her intelligence protects her from physical harm
- Assumes expensive education means she knows better than locals

**How it kills them:**
Emma's naive romanticism about "authentic" colonial architecture leads her to specifically request the room in the oldest part of the building - the section staff know is structurally compromised. Her refusal to move when offered newer accommodation seals her fate.

## Physical Appearance
- **Height/Build:** 5'4", slim, hasn't quite grown into herself yet
- **Hair:** Light brown, usually in a practical ponytail or braid
- **Distinguishing features:** Reading glasses she's embarrassed about, ink stains on fingers from journaling, small scar on knee from hockey
- **Typical outfit:** Sensible hiking sandals, linen pants, vintage band t-shirts from her dad's collection

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Intellectually curious - becomes obsession with "authenticity" over safety
2. Independent - becomes stubborn refusal to accept help or advice

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Unconscious privilege - assumes bad things happen to other people
2. Romantic idealization of poverty/age - leads to staying in dangerous room

### Pet Peeves
- Other gap year students who "don't really engage" with cultures
- Hostels that are "too modern"
- Her parents texting to check on her

### Fears
- Surface fear: Being seen as a basic tourist
- Deeper fear: That she's not actually special, just privileged

## Background

### Origin Story
Born to a surgeon father and solicitor mother in Surrey. Private school, excellent grades, head of the debating society. Gap year was her parents' idea - "broaden your horizons before Cambridge." She's been trying to prove she can handle it, that she's not just another posh girl playing at adventure.

### Why They Travel
Officially: cultural enrichment before university. Actually: desperate to have experiences that make her interesting, to have stories that aren't about prep school and privilege. Wants to prove she's not what everyone assumes.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Found it in an "off-the-beaten-path" travel blog. Specifically chose it over modern options because the blog mentioned "crumbling colonial charm" and "sleeping in history." Booked the "Heritage Room" because it was the oldest part of the building.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "authentic," "problematic," "intersectional," "liminal space," "discourse"
- Avoids words like: "scared," "can't," "help"
- Catchphrases: "Well, actually...", "It's more nuanced than that," "I've read that..."

### Speech Pattern
- Overly articulate, sometimes pretentious
- Hedges statements with academic qualifiers
- Received Pronunciation she sometimes tries to downplay
- Uses vocabulary to establish intelligence

### Internal Monologue Style
Constant self-narration as if writing her future memoir. Analytical but emotionally distant. Evaluates experiences for their future story value.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Instagram (aesthetic), Twitter (takes)
- **Follower count:** 847 (mostly school friends, some family)
- **Posting style:** Long captions about "meaningful encounters," artsy architecture shots, quotes from books
- **Last post before death:** Photo of the cracked ceiling beams with caption "400 years of stories in these walls. Sometimes authenticity means accepting imperfection."

### Online vs Reality
Posts about "connecting with local communities" - reality: she's had one awkward conversation with a taxi driver. Posts about "leaving comfort zones" - reality: she's homesick and scared but would never admit it.

## Relationships

### Family
- Father: Proud but worried, sends money she accepts guiltily
- Mother: Micromanages from afar, Emma ignores most texts
- Younger brother: Thinks her gap year is "extra," she resents him for saying what she secretly fears

### Friends
- School friends already at uni, their lives moving on without her
- Travel "friends" are really just people she's spent a few days with

### Romantic
- Brief fling with an Australian surfer in Mexico that she's already mythologized into a great romance

### At the Hostel
- Mildly condescending to other gap year students
- Respects the Colombian owner in a way that borders on patronizing
- Has not made any genuine connections in two weeks of traveling

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Woke early to journal. Wrote three pages about the "weight of colonialism" visible in the architecture. Took photos of the morning light through the cracked wooden shutters. Ignored the fresh crack in the ceiling plaster.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Lying in her bottom bunk reading "One Hundred Years of Solitude" (because of course), hearing the rain intensify, feeling pleased that she was having an "authentic" experience while other tourists were in sterile hotels.

### Final Thoughts
In the darkness, pinned by rubble: "Mum was right. Mum was right. I'm so sorry, I was so stupid, mummy please--"

### Last Words
"Help! Someone please--" (dust fills her lungs before she can finish)
