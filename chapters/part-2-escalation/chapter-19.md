# Chapter 19: The False Calm

The crack did not close. It only paused, like a mouth deciding how to speak.

The dust settled in slow motion, the headlamp beam turning each particle into a tiny floating fact. I coughed, tasted chalk, and wiped my mouth with the back of my hand. My skin came away white. The crack above the bed was thicker now, a jagged seam with the lath beneath peeking through in thin, dark ribs. Water ran along the beam in a gleaming line. The beam looked slick, like a wet back.

I sat there for a second, knees up, and waited for the next sound the way you wait for the second clap of thunder to tell you how far away the storm is. Nothing. Just the rain, the relentless hiss of it, the wind pushing the shutters in a rhythm that made the room breathe. I could feel the bed frame vibrating through the mattress, a small, continuous tremor.

I told myself I would count to ten and then stand. I counted to five and stood anyway. The floor bowed under my weight, a soft, unwilling dip. The sponginess had an edge to it now, not just dampness but fatigue, as if the wood had gotten tired of pretending it was strong.

I grabbed my bag and slung it over my shoulder. The strap dug into the damp of my shirt. I went to the door and turned the handle. It stuck, then moved a fraction. I lifted, pulled, coaxed, the wood scraping with a dry, unhappy sound. The door opened enough to show the hallway, a thin sliver of light, the bulb flickering like it was blinking awake. I squeezed through.

The hallway smelled worse than my room, damp plaster and mildew, a sourness that made my throat feel coated. The walls glistened in places where water had seeped through. The floor dipped toward the outer wall, a shallow incline that made me walk with a careful tilt, my hand sliding along the balustrade for balance. The banister was slick and cool. The building felt like an animal sweating under a blanket.

From the top of the stairs, I looked down into the courtyard and saw the common room lights still on. A few silhouettes moved slowly, night people in borrowed sleep. The rain hammered the courtyard tiles and pooled around the broken fountain, the water in the basin overflowing like a chin that couldn't stop drooling. I could have gone down and joined them, sat on a damp mattress and tried to forget I had chosen this room.

Instead I stood there and listened. The building made a low, internal sound, a long creak that ended in a small pop, like a knuckle cracking deep in its joints. The sound came from above, from somewhere in the ceiling space, and it made my stomach knot.

I took one step down. The stair dipped under my foot. The wood was slick, and I tightened my grip on the banister. The next step felt the same. The next felt softer. The stairs were tired too.

“Emma?” A voice floated up, muffled by rain and distance. June, from below.

“I’m fine,” I called back. It was automatic. It was what I said to keep my story intact.

“Come down!” she called, sharper now.

I looked back over my shoulder at the hallway. My door stood open a crack, a dark rectangle. The bed was barely visible through the mosquito net, the headlamp light still on like a weak spotlight. The room looked like it was waiting, not for me, but for gravity.

I went down two more steps. The building groaned in response, a sound of protest. A trickle of water ran along the stairwell wall, leaving a wet line that was new. It slid toward the lower landing and disappeared into the darkness.

I stopped. I didn’t go back up. I didn’t go all the way down. I stood on the stairs, balanced between, and felt the absurdity of it settle into my bones. This was where I was most comfortable: the place that counted as almost leaving.

The wind shoved at the building, hard enough to rattle the shutters. The banister vibrated in my hand. A small shower of plaster dust slipped from the ceiling above and landed on the steps, a pale sprinkling. I took it as a sign even though I didn’t know what it meant.

I walked down to the common room.

The mattresses in the main room were scattered like fallen petals. People were asleep in odd shapes, arms draped over bags, legs tangled in damp blankets. June was sitting upright against a wall, her hair a halo of frizz, her eyes open. She looked relieved and irritated at the same time.

“Thank you,” she said.

“I just needed air,” I said, because that was less embarrassing than saying I was scared.

Carlos was standing by the reception desk, a coffee in his hand that had gone cold. He glanced at me and nodded, a gesture of relief. I felt a flash of irritation at being relieved for. I sat on a mattress near the doorway and listened to the rain.

The common room smelled of wet clothes and stale bread. The air was humid, but it didn’t have the sharp edge of the heritage wing. It felt normal, which should have been comforting. It made me feel guilty instead, like I was cheating on my own narrative.

After a while, I fell into a shallow sleep, the kind that never quite takes hold. I woke to the sound of chairs being scraped across tile. Dawn had arrived, gray and wet, pushing a thin light through the courtyard arches.

Carlos was speaking to a small group of guests, his voice tired but steady. “The heritage wing is closed until the inspector returns,” he said, in Spanish and then in English. “It is not safe in the rain. Please, stay in the modern rooms for now.”

A blond guy in a tank top rolled his eyes. “I booked the vibe,” he said. It sounded like a joke and an accusation.

“The vibe is wet,” Carlos said. It was the closest thing to humor I’d heard from him in days. It made a few people laugh.

He looked at me when he said “closed,” and I looked away. The words sat between us like a small judgment. I told myself it was temporary. I told myself I was only downstairs because of the storm, not because I was convinced. I told myself that made a difference.

When the rain softened to a steady drizzle, people began to move. Some went to the kitchen to make coffee. Someone opened the front door and let in a blast of warm, wet air. The city outside smelled of damp stone and fried oil, the morning already alive with vendor calls.

June leaned down toward me. “Stay down here today,” she said. “At least today.”

“I will,” I said, which was true in the smallest way. I stayed down for an hour.

The moment the courtyard grew busy, the moment the air felt ordinary again, I felt the pull upstairs like a muscle memory. My room was above, full of my things and my choices, and I needed to see it in daylight. That was the excuse. The truth was that I needed to see if the story had survived the night.

I waited until Carlos turned his back and then slipped toward the heritage stairwell. The door was ajar. The hallway beyond looked darker than it had yesterday, as if the light refused to follow. The air changed as soon as I stepped over the threshold, cooler and heavier, smelling of wet plaster and old wood.

The stairs creaked under my feet. The banister was slick. At the top landing, I paused. The hallway was empty, the doors closed. A faint line of water ran along the baseboard like a vein. The plaster on the walls was blotched and yellowed, the moisture making it look bruised.

I opened my door. The room was bright in a thin, sickly way, sunlight filtered through shutters and rain clouds. The dust from last night lay on the bed like a powdery frost. The crack in the ceiling had widened again, the lath beneath exposed in a dark zigzag. The beam looked darker, swollen, the wood grain raised. The mosquito net hung limp, damp at the edges.

The floor was worse. The bed legs had sunk deeper into the boards, the metal feet leaving oval impressions that looked like footprints. When I stepped into the room, the floor dipped under me with a soft, rubbery give. It was no longer subtle. It was tired.

I set my palm against the wall and felt dampness seep into my skin. The plaster was soft. When I pulled away, my hand was dusty and white, the chalk sticking to my fingerprints. I looked at it, at the ghost of the wall on my skin, and felt something like affection. The building was leaving its mark on me. It felt significant. It was probably just water.

I took my phone out and took a photo. In the morning light, the crack looked almost graceful, a dark line like a river on a map. The dust on the sheets glowed. The room was cinematic. I imagined the caption: “Soft architecture. Soft choices.” I laughed quietly and didn’t post it. The laughter felt like a betrayal of my fear.

I opened my notebook and wrote, the pen scratching the damp paper.

The room is bruised. I am too. We are both pretending it’s only aesthetic.

I underlined bruised and closed the notebook. The words made me feel too exposed. I could write about the building. I could not write about myself without making it sound like a caption.

A soft knock on the door made me jump.

June leaned in, her eyes wide. “I knew you’d be up here,” she said.

“I just wanted to see,” I said.

“See what?” She gestured at the ceiling, the floor, the damp wall. “That it’s still collapsing?”

“It’s not collapsing,” I said, which was an argument I didn’t believe.

“It will,” she said, blunt as a brick.

The silence that followed was full of the room’s small noises: the drip in the corner, the creak of the beam, the soft, constant hiss of rain against the shutters. It sounded like the building clearing its throat.

June looked at me. “You can visit it,” she said. “Write about it. But you can’t sleep under it. You promised me.”

“I promised a lot of people a lot of things,” I said.

“That’s not a reason to break this one.” She took a breath, softened. “You can still be interesting from the safe room.”

“I know,” I said. “It just feels like giving up.”

She looked at the bed, its legs sunk into the floor. “Giving up is not the same as giving in,” she said. “Sometimes it’s just stopping.”

I didn’t answer. I didn’t know how to answer. The building creaked, a long, tired sound, as if it was bored with us.

June sighed. “I’m going downstairs. Ana made coffee. You coming?”

“In a minute,” I said.

She stared at me long enough to make me feel like a child. Then she left. Her footsteps down the hallway were loud in the damp silence.

I stood in the room and listened to the drip. The floor felt soft under my feet. The wall was damp. The air tasted of chalk. This room was not safe. That was a fact. But facts were not the only currency I dealt in. I traded in meaning, in story, in the way a moment could be made to look like a choice rather than a mistake.

I went downstairs.

---

The day tried to pretend the storm had been a dream. The sun came back in brief, arrogant bursts between clouds. The courtyard dried in patches, the tiles looking clean and glossy where the water had washed them. A street vendor pushed a cart past the open door, the smell of fried arepas curling in and competing with the mildew. People laughed again. The world resumed.

I sat at the plastic table with a mug of coffee that tasted like burnt sugar and fatigue. June and Ana talked about the beach, about whether the water would be too rough to swim. Mark, a Canadian guy who had arrived last night, listened with a polite smile. He wore a shirt that said SALTY in big letters. It felt like a joke the universe had written for him.

Carlos hovered near the reception desk, fielding complaints and questions. A middle-aged couple asked for a refund because they had booked the heritage wing. Carlos apologized, offered the modern rooms at a discount. The woman made a face as if she had been offered a seat in economy after buying business class.

“People want history,” June muttered to me. “They just don’t want to pay for it with discomfort.”

I wanted to argue. I wanted to say I was different. I didn’t. The difference was mostly a story, and she knew it.

When I took my cup to the kitchen, Marta was there, wringing out a mop. She watched me from the corner of her eye, her expression flat.

“Good morning,” I said.

She nodded, then glanced toward the heritage hallway. She made a small motion with her hand, a crossing gesture. “No entres,” she said. Don’t go in.

“I’m not staying there now,” I said, as if that were enough.

She looked at me, and for a second her face softened. “You are young,” she said. “The house is old. It does not care.” Her Spanish was slow and clear, as if she wanted me to understand each word.

I wanted to respond with something clever about colonialism and capitalism. I wanted to say I knew. Instead I nodded and said, “Gracias,” because that was all I had.

Back in the courtyard, I checked my phone. The weather app showed a storm band still offshore, a tight spiral with a warning triangle. “Tropical storm watch continues,” it said. The map made the storm look polite, a simple swirl of color. The sound of it had been anything but.

I opened Instagram without thinking. The cracked-ceiling photo glowed in my drafts, the likes from the earlier post still ticking up. Someone had commented: “Careful, babe.” It was from a girl I knew in school who had never left Surrey. The comment felt like a wink and a warning, and I didn’t know which was worse.

I put my phone away. The coffee tasted like metal and sugar. The air smelled of wet stone and frying oil. The day was warm enough to dry my shirt but not my nerves.

By mid-afternoon, the courtyard was full of people again. Someone played reggaeton from a phone. A couple in the corner studied a map and argued about islands. The hostel felt like itself, casual and messy and too loud for my head. The building had been wounded, but everyone had decided it wasn’t bleeding.

Carlos passed by my table and set down a small paper. It was a copy of the waiver, the same paragraph of legal language, the same signature line. “Just in case,” he said. “If you want to stay in the heritage wing again, my uncle says we need a new signature. Updated.”

“It’s the same,” I said, scanning the page. It was a wall of words, half English, half Spanish, the key phrases bolded: NOT LIABLE. ASSUME ALL RISK.

He shrugged. “His lawyer says we need a new one because the storm.” He looked at me as if he wanted to apologize and didn’t know how.

I should have handed it back. I should have refused to sign. I took the pen anyway and wrote my name in the line, neat loops of ink. The signature looked like a dare.

Carlos folded the paper and tucked it into his folder. “Please,” he said. “Just be careful.”

“I will,” I said, the same promise for the third time this week.

The act of signing made something settle in me. I had made the decision again, in ink. The building, the room, the story: I was still choosing it.

That evening, the clouds gathered again, thick and low, the sky bruising over the rooftops. The air turned heavy, the kind of heavy that makes you want to close windows and sit close to people. The wind picked up, the bougainvillea in the courtyard shaking as if it were shivering.

June and Ana came back from the beach with salt in their hair and sunburn on their noses. They looked happy in the tired way that comes from being outside in bad weather anyway. They asked if I wanted to get dinner. I said I wasn’t hungry, which was a lie. I was hungry for different things.

As they left to find food, I stood in the courtyard and watched the sky darken. The storm looked like it was thinking. The first drops hit the tiles with a quiet patience.

I found myself in the heritage hallway again before I could name the choice. The air up there was cooler and damp, the smell like an old book left in a basement. My footsteps were loud on the warped boards. The door to my room was slightly open, as if I had left it invitingly. I hadn’t.

Inside, the room was dim. The light from the shutters was gray and thin. The crack had not closed. The beam looked darker. The floor felt softer under my feet. I set my bag on the bed and felt the frame sink another fraction, a tiny surrender.

I told myself I would only stay long enough to grab a sweater. I told myself I could leave if the rain intensified. I told myself I was in control of this. The storm did not care about what I told myself.

I sat on the bed anyway. The mattress was damp and cold. The mosquito net brushed my arm, a faint tickle that felt like a warning. I stared at the crack and tried to imagine it as a static thing, a line that could stay a line.

The rain thickened. The shutters rattled. The beam creaked, a slow, deep sound, the kind that makes your chest respond before your brain does. I put my palm on the bed frame and felt it vibrate. The floor beneath it seemed to pulse, a slow, tired giving.

My phone buzzed with a new alert: “Wind gusts increasing.” The notification lit the room for a second, a cold blue rectangle of modern concern. I swiped it away. I didn’t want to be told what to do by an app.

I opened my notebook and wrote because writing was the only way I knew to make the fear feel like a choice.

The building is not angry. It is just old and wet. It is not personal. It feels personal because I am the one under it.

I stopped and looked up. The crack seemed wider in the dim light. A thin flake of plaster loosened and fell onto my page, a small white comma. I brushed it off and kept writing.

My stomach growled. The room smelled of damp and dust. The rain made a steady, insistent sound, not yet violent, but with a rhythm that promised it could become something else. The air was thick enough to feel like cloth against my skin.

A knock on the door made me flinch.

“Emma?” June’s voice, muffled through wood and rain. “Are you up there?”

I swallowed. “Just getting my sweater.”

There was a pause. I could hear the rain through it. “Come down,” she said. “It’s starting again.”

“In a minute,” I said.

She sighed, the sound a mix of frustration and resignation. “If you die for your brand, I’m deleting your drafts,” she said, and I laughed, a short, real laugh that surprised me.

“Deal,” I called back.

Her footsteps receded. The hallway settled into its damp quiet again.

I should have left. The humor had given me an opening to do the sensible thing. Instead I stayed, because I was nineteen and stubborn and convinced that small acts of defiance were proof I wasn’t ordinary.

The rain shifted, heavier now, a thicker drum on the shutters. The building responded with a deep groan that ran along the beam like a hand. The bed frame creaked. The floor dipped under my knees. I felt the movement in my spine.

I opened the shutter a crack and looked out. The street below was blurred with rain. A palm tree bent in the wind, its fronds flattened. A piece of tin skittered across the road, the same one from the night before, or maybe a different one. The world was slippery and loud.

I closed the shutter and leaned my forehead against it. The wood was wet and warm. I could smell the rain in the street, the sea beyond, the rot in the walls. It all mixed into a single, heavy scent: the smell of something old being asked to hold too much.

I turned back to the room. The crack looked like a smile now, a dark curve in the ceiling. The beam was glossy. Water dripped in a steady rhythm from a new spot near the wall. The floor was damp where the drip landed, a small, shining circle that grew with each drop. I moved the cup underneath it and watched the water collect. It looked clear. It tasted like wood.

I told myself I would leave after the cup filled. The cup filled faster than it should have.

The door handle rattled. I stood, heart thumping. The handle rattled again, a small, insistent shake. Then the door moved, scraping against the swollen frame. Carlos stood there, his hair damp, his eyes tired.

“Emma,” he said softly. “Please.”

His voice did something my own internal monologue could not. It made the danger feel real, not aesthetic. I looked at him, at the damp shine of his shirt, the fine lines at the corners of his eyes that were deeper than yesterday. He was not being dramatic. He was being practical in a building that did not reward it.

“Okay,” I said.

I grabbed my bag. The bed frame groaned as I stood. The floor dipped under my feet. I felt a small, almost tender regret, the way you feel leaving a place that you know you shouldn’t have loved.

Carlos waited in the hallway, stepping back to let me pass. The hallway was damp and dim. The light bulb flickered. As I walked past the bathroom, a new crack in the wall caught my eye, a thin line branching toward the ceiling. It had not been there an hour ago. Or it had been and I had been looking elsewhere.

We went down the stairs carefully. Each step dipped under us. The banister was slick. The building groaned with each gust of wind. I could feel Carlos’s hand hover near my elbow, not touching but ready, as if he could steady the building by steadying me.

In the common room, a few people looked up. June was at the table with a mug of coffee, her eyes tired. She gave me a small smile that said I told you so and I’m glad you’re here.

I set my bag down on the floor and sank onto a chair. The chair felt solid. The ceiling above felt normal. The rain hammered on the courtyard tiles and the building groaned, but down here the sound was less intimate, less personal. It was just weather.

I looked at my phone. Another weather alert. The storm was not done. The map showed the spiral tightening, the colors deepening. The warning triangle pulsed again.

I looked up at the ceiling and felt, for a moment, a relief so sharp it was almost anger. I was safe. I had chosen it. And above, the heritage wing creaked under the weight of its history and its water, waiting for the next decision I would make.

The wind hit the building hard enough to make the lights flicker. Somewhere above, a deep, splintering crack sounded, sharp as a gunshot. The room went still. We all heard it.

I swallowed and looked toward the stairs. The sound came from the heritage wing.

I sat very still, waiting to hear what came next.
