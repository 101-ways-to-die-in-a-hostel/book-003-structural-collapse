# Chapter 18: The Weight of Water

The floor shifted under my feet as if the house were testing how much I weighed.

I stood with my bag half-zipped, one hand on the doorframe, and felt the boards bow with a slow, wet softness. The movement was subtle, not a dramatic lurch, but enough to make my stomach drop. Somewhere above, the beam gave a deep, tired groan, a sound like an old man adjusting his back in the dark.

I froze, waiting for the rest of it — the crack, the fall, the instant movie collapse — and got only the storm’s steady roar. The rain was a drum on the shutters. The air smelled of damp wood and old plaster, a sour sweet smell that stuck to the back of my tongue. The drip in the cup had become a thin, patient stream, and it threaded down the beam in a line of water that looked like sweat.

I took my bag off the bed and set it on the chair. The floor sank under the chair legs with a little sigh. I had chosen a bed in a room that slanted toward the wall, and now I was watching the wall win. The irony wasn’t funny. It was precise.

I should have left right then. I should have forced the door, stumbled down the stairs, and slept on the common room couch if I had to. Instead I stood there, waiting for the building to confess.

The cup overflowed. Water spread across the floorboards, a thin, shining film that ran toward the corner. I grabbed the cup, sloshed it into my bottle, and watched the boards drink it greedily. The wood felt thirsty, soft, swollen. I wondered how many days it could be wet before it gave up.

I told myself, You are not scared. You are observant. That was my favorite lie, the one that made fear into a kind of scholarship.

---

I left the door open and stepped into the hallway, my bag strap bumping against my hip. The corridor was dim, the light bulb above the bathroom flickering like a tired eyelid. The air felt cooler out here, but it was the kind of cool that comes from dampness, not relief. The plaster on the walls was blotched with wet patches, and the whitewash had gone yellow in places, like old paper left in the sun.

The floor dipped toward the outer wall, more dramatically than in my room. I put my hand on the balustrade and felt it vibrate with the wind. The building was not still. It was a tired animal, shifting its weight from foot to foot.

I made it to the top of the stairs and looked down into the brighter part of the hostel. The lights were still on in reception, a small island of warm yellow. I could see Carlos moving behind the desk, his silhouette crossing and pausing. He had one hand to his ear. The other pushed at the desk as if holding himself up.

I could go down and tell him I wanted to move. I could say the word “now,” and it would sound urgent enough to be believed. He had offered twice already. He would not be surprised; he would be relieved. But the thought of walking into the safe, modern dorm felt like walking into an apology. It would mean admitting I had asked for this room because I wanted to be interesting. It would mean admitting I wasn’t.

I put my foot on the first stair. The wood beneath it sagged. It was only a little, but it was enough to make my ankle wobble. The steps were slick with humidity, the edges worn smooth. The air smelled of wet stone and bleach.

Someone laughed in the courtyard. The sound floated up, bright and careless, and I felt an ache of jealousy. There were people downstairs who were not counting cracks, not listening to beams. There were people who would wake tomorrow with clean sheets and a mild hangover, who would go on a tour and take photos and never know the building had held its breath for them.

“Emma?” a voice called, muffled by the rain and the walls. It was June. “Are you awake?”

I held my breath. I could answer. I could say, I’m coming down. I could be practical for once.

Instead I waited.

“Emma,” she called again, closer this time. Her voice had the kind of bored impatience that meant she was worried.

“I’m fine,” I called back, which was a lie we both knew.

There was a pause. I heard the scrape of a chair, the thud of footsteps on the tiles. “You sure?” she asked.

“Yes,” I said. “Just couldn’t sleep.”

She muttered something, probably a swear. I heard her footsteps move away. I stood at the top of the stairs with my bag in my hand, my heart beating too fast, and realized I had not moved in the time it took for her to ask twice.

In the corridor, the light bulb flickered and went out, then buzzed and came back. The sudden dimness made me blink. The building shuddered again, a deep, slow sway that I felt through my palm on the banister.

I turned back toward my room. The doorway was a dark rectangle, the mosquito net inside like a pale ghost. I could see the cup on the floor, the spilled water glinting in the phone light I had left on the bed. The room looked like it was already haunted, even though I was still in it.

I walked back, the floorboards creaking under me, and stepped over the threshold. The door scraped against the frame as if it didn’t want to let me in or out. I closed it, not out of fear, but out of habit. The sound was soft and final.

I set my bag down again. I unzipped it, then zipped it, then unzipped it. I was a person rehearsing leaving without leaving.

---

To distract myself, I opened my notebook and began to write, because if I could turn this into text, maybe it could not turn into tragedy.

The building is drinking, I wrote. It is full of rain and history and the weight of all the people who thought this was a good idea.

I paused and reread it. It sounded like a caption. I crossed out history and wrote water instead, because water was the real villain tonight. Water was patient. Water was relentless. It didn’t need a motive.

The rain hit the shutters in heavy sheets. The wood flexed with each gust, a low, complaining sound. The beam above me creaked again, a single long note that made my shoulders rise. I looked up at the crack in the plaster and saw a thin, dark line widen by a fraction. The crack was not dramatic. It was mundane, the kind of change you only notice if you watch too long.

I took the headlamp from my bag and clicked it on. The beam of light cut the room into a tunnel. Dust particles floated through it, tiny motes dancing as if they had a reason to be there. I swept the light across the ceiling. The plaster was damp, the crack dark and soft at the edges. A thin trail of water ran along the beam, pooling where it met the wall.

The mosquito net caught the light and glowed, a pale web. It wasn’t supposed to be a trap, but it looked like one now. I reached up and pulled it aside, leaving the bed uncovered. If the ceiling fell, I wanted one less thing between me and movement.

I laughed, a short sound that shocked me. I was preparing for a collapse like it was an exam. Studying the exits. Removing obstacles. Telling myself that being ready meant it wouldn’t happen.

The bed frame creaked as I sat on it. The legs sank a little deeper into the wood, a slow, tired give. I slid my palm across the floorboards. The surface was damp, the grain raised. When I pressed my thumb into it, the wood gave slightly, the impression staying for a moment before rising back. The building was soft in the way a bruise is soft.

The power flickered again. The bulb in the hallway blinked out. The light in my room — the bare bulb hanging from a wire — dimmed and returned with a buzz. The storm outside roared louder, as if it had heard the lights and was annoyed by them.

I got up and pushed at the shutter with both hands. The wood was swollen and uncooperative, but I managed to open it a crack. Wind rushed in, warm and wet. The street below was a blur of rain and yellow light. The palm trees across the way bent at an angle that made my chest tighten. A piece of corrugated metal skittered down the road, sparking when it hit a puddle.

I closed the shutter again and turned back to the room. The air inside felt thicker, almost liquid. I could taste the dampness, a metallic tang that made my tongue feel coated. The smell was stronger now — mildew, old wood, wet plaster, the faint sourness of something rotting in the wall.

I considered going down to the common room just to sit with other people, to borrow their normalcy for an hour. But the idea of carrying my bag down the stairs and then coming back up felt like an admission. It felt like failure, which was ridiculous. But my life had been built on avoiding that feeling. I had done it at school, in exams, in friendships. I could do it here too. I could stay.

I set the headlamp on the bed, still on, its light aimed at the ceiling like a vigil. I lay down and stared at the crack. The storm pressed against the building with a steady weight. Somewhere below, someone dropped a bottle, the sound ringing like a bell in the quiet between thunder. I listened to the building’s responses: a low groan here, a sharp creak there, the occasional scrape as wood shifted against wood.

I thought about my mother’s message. I thought about the lie I had sent. I imagined her in bed in Surrey, the rain outside her window polite and quiet, the house warm and sound. I imagined her waking in the morning and checking her phone, her eyes squinting against the light. I imagined her reading my message again and believing it because she wanted to.

The crack above me widened by another hair. A thin line of plaster flaked off and fell, landing on my cheek like ash. I brushed it away and left a pale streak on my skin. The plaster was soft, almost chalky. It crumbled between my fingers.

“Buildings breathe,” I whispered. “Buildings settle.” I said it like a mantra, like something I had read. It sounded foolish out loud.

The storm answered with a boom of thunder that made the room vibrate. The bed shook. The headlamp flickered. The beam above me groaned again, deeper this time. I pressed my palms into the mattress, as if I could feel whether the wood was about to split.

In that moment I remembered the waiver, the paragraph Carlos had pointed to. Old buildings can fall. People can die. I had turned it into a joke, a line in a story. I had made it aesthetic. Now it sat in the back of my mind like a warning label you pretend not to see but can still read out of the corner of your eye.

I sat up and swung my feet to the floor. The boards dipped. I hated how predictable the sensation had become. I hated how used to it I was.

I found my phone and opened Instagram, not to post but to look. The signal was weak. The feed loaded slowly, a handful of images and sponsored posts: a girl on a beach, a brand ad, someone’s latte art. I scrolled with my thumb and felt detached, as if I were watching life through a pane of foggy glass.

A notification popped up: “3 people liked your photo.” It was the cracked ceiling shot from two days ago, the one I had posted with the caption about authenticity. It had a comment from a girl I went to school with: “Looks magical!” I laughed, a raw sound that made me cough. The room was not magical. It was damp and tired and waiting.

I closed the app. I put the phone face down. I told myself I would write in the morning instead.

The bed creaked again. The floor sighed. The room smelled of damp and dust and my own sweat. I lay down and tried to breathe slowly, to match my breath to the building’s rhythm. It didn’t help.

The door handle rattled. I sat up, heart thudding. The handle moved again, a soft jiggle, then a knock.

“Emma?” It was Carlos, his voice low through the wood.

I swung out of bed and crossed the room in two steps. I opened the door enough to see his face, pale in the hall light. He looked exhausted. There were damp spots on his shirt from the rain.

“Sorry,” he said. “We are checking the rooms. The storm is strong.”

“Is everything okay?” I asked. I meant the building. I meant myself.

He hesitated. His eyes flicked up, toward the ceiling. He lowered his voice. “Maybe you should come down,” he said. “Sleep in the common room. Just for tonight.”

I could hear the plea in his voice, the weariness. It made me want to do the opposite, just to not be managed. “I’m fine,” I said, and the stubbornness in my own voice surprised me.

He looked at me like he wanted to argue, but he didn’t. He nodded once, a gesture of resignation more than agreement. “If you need,” he said, and then he was gone down the hallway, his footsteps quiet on the wet boards.

I closed the door and leaned my forehead against it. The wood was damp. I could feel the cold through my skin. I wanted to go after him and say yes. I wanted to keep the story intact. I did neither.

I went to the bathroom instead, because it was something to do with my hands. The hallway seemed narrower now, the walls bowed slightly inward. The light above the bathroom flickered, then steadied. I could hear the rain through the shutters, a low roar like the sea. The floor under my feet gave with each step, a slow soft give that made the boards squeak in apology.

The bathroom door stuck, and when it opened the smell of mold hit me in the face. The mirror was a cloudy rectangle, the light bulb above it blinking as if it might give up. Water dripped from the corner of the ceiling into the shower, each drop a sharp ping against the tile. The sink was wet already, a thin sheen of water that pooled toward the drain. I turned on the tap and the water came out brown for a second, then cleared. The metallic smell made me wrinkle my nose.

I washed my face anyway. The water was cold and smelled faintly of rust. I stared at my reflection. My eyes looked too bright in the bad light. My skin was damp, my hair frizzed from the humidity, and the band of my sports bra had left a red mark on my shoulder. I looked like a person who had been up all night and was pretending not to be.

There was a hairline crack in the wall above the toilet, a thin branching line I didn’t remember seeing earlier. It could have been there for months. It could have appeared in the last hour. The bathroom was a catalog of decay — peeling paint, a tile missing by the shower, a faint line of green mold tracing the grout — and the crack was just another entry. But I watched it anyway, like it might move if I stared long enough.

From the window above the sink, I could see the courtyard. The rain made a dark pool around the broken fountain. A few plastic chairs had tipped over, legs in the air like dead insects. June and Mark were under the overhang, their silhouettes close together, both hunched against the weather. I couldn’t hear them over the rain, but I could imagine the conversation: Should we move? Is it safe? Do you think the old wing will hold? The kind of conversation I could have been part of if I weren’t standing in a bathroom that smelled like wet plaster.

I thought about Day of the Dead, the paper skulls I’d seen in the market that morning. Bright colors, cheerful teeth. The locals celebrated their dead with sugar and music. I wondered if death would feel as ordinary as a holiday if you lived with it long enough. The thought was both comforting and grotesque. I could make a caption out of it, if I wanted. I didn’t.

The light flickered and went out. I stood in the dark for a second, my heartbeat loud. Then the bulb buzzed and came back, weaker than before. The building felt like a person trying to stay awake when they’re too tired.

On impulse, I opened the stall door and lifted the toilet lid, as if checking the water level could tell me something. It couldn’t. It was just water, just a small domestic object in a large failing building. I let the lid fall with a soft clack and felt ridiculous.

I took my phone out and checked the weather app. The screen loaded slowly, the signal weak. A red triangle alert icon pulsed. “Tropical storm warning,” it said in Spanish. The forecast showed the eye of the storm rolling closer to the coast. The time stamp was an hour ago. The word “probability” sat above the line like a joke.

I shut off the water and dried my hands on my shirt. The fabric stuck to my skin. I looked at my face again. I looked younger in the bad light, not the worldly version of myself I was trying to build. I looked like someone who should be told what to do. I imagined my mother standing behind me, her hand on my shoulder, telling me to leave. I imagined arguing with her about authenticity. I hated both versions of myself.

When I left the bathroom, the hallway was empty. The air felt thicker, the dampness heavier. The floor groaned beneath me. The building made a low, tired sound, as if it had been holding its breath and was finally exhaling.

I paused by the railing and looked down again at the reception. Carlos was gone. The light behind the desk was off. The only light came from the courtyard, where a stray string of bulbs swayed in the wind. I was alone with the building, and the building felt too large to be alone with.

I went back to my room and closed the door. I could feel the frame resist, the wood swollen and tight. I pressed my shoulder against it until it latched. The sound was final. I told myself it was just a door. I told myself doors are supposed to close.

---

The storm intensified in the hours that followed. The rain became a continuous roar, the wind a constant pressure against the walls. The room felt smaller with each gust, as if the building were inhaling and not exhaling. I lay on the bed with the headlamp on, the light fixed on the ceiling like a stage spotlight waiting for a performer.

I counted the creaks. I counted the drops. I counted the times I considered leaving and didn’t. Somewhere in the counting I fell into a shallow sleep and woke with my heart racing, the taste of dust in my mouth. The crack above me had widened again, not by much, but enough to make the line look jagged instead of smooth. A tiny wedge of plaster had fallen and landed on my book. I brushed it off, leaving a white smudge on the cover.

My phone vibrated. Another message from my mother, sent an hour ago: “Storm looks bad on the news. Please tell me you’re in the safe room.” I stared at it until the screen dimmed. I typed, “Yes. All good.” I hit send before I could change my mind. The lie felt heavy, a brick on my chest.

A deep, splintering sound came from above — not the small creak, but a dry crack like a branch snapping underfoot. My body tensed. I sat up, my hand already on the mosquito net even though I had pushed it aside. The room was still. The sound did not repeat. The storm continued.

I stood and walked to the wall. I pressed my palm to the plaster and felt it cool and damp. The wall trembled faintly, a vibration that was either the wind or the building itself. I could feel the softness of the adobe beneath the plaster, the give of something that should not give.

In the hallway, a light flicked on, then off. Footsteps passed, then the faint sound of a door closing. The hostel was awake in pockets, a few people moving through the storm. The rest were asleep, trusting the roof.

I knelt and put my ear to the floor. The wood smelled of mildew and old varnish. I could hear the building’s low murmur, a sound like a ship in a slow swell. It made me feel seasick.

I got back into bed. I lay on my side, my face toward the wall. The mosquito net, pushed aside, brushed my arm. I let it, a comfort or a trap, depending on the next few hours.

At some point the rain shifted, a change in rhythm that felt like a warning. The wind hit the wall with a force that made the shutters tremble. The beam above me groaned in a long, continuous line. I could feel the bed frame vibrate with it, as if it were connected to the beam by invisible strings.

“Hold,” I whispered. “Just hold.”

The building did not answer.

There was a deeper sound, a low, dragging scrape from somewhere beyond the room, as if something heavy had moved across stone. It was not thunder. It was inside. The hair on my arms lifted. I sat up and turned the headlamp toward the door, as if light could protect me.

I got up and went to the door. The handle was stiff. I turned it and pulled. The door opened a few centimeters, then caught. I tugged harder, and it scraped, a dry sound of wood against wood. The door opened another inch and stopped. The frame had shifted again, the gap uneven.

I stared at the thin strip of hallway light. I could still get out if I forced it, I told myself. But the door was reminding me that the building was not a fixed thing. It could move around me while I slept. It could decide to close me in.

I forced the door open, just to prove I could. The corridor was empty. The light bulb buzzed. The walls looked damp and close. I closed the door again, softer this time, and listened to the latch settle with a reluctant click.

I went back to bed. The headlamp was warm to the touch. I switched it off to save the battery. The room sank into darkness. The crack was still there, unseen but present. The storm was still there, heard but unseen. I lay in the dark with my eyes open, the sound of my breath loud in my head.

Something fell in the hallway — a light clatter, then a heavier thud. I sat up, heart hammering. No voices followed. The hostel went quiet again. The rain kept coming.

The beam gave another low groan, a tired, resigned sound. The floor under the bed dipped a fraction. I felt it in my spine, the way you feel a change in a room before you can name it. The bed had moved, imperceptibly, toward the wall.

I slid my hand across the sheet and felt grit under my fingers. More plaster had fallen. I brushed it away. It kept coming.

“Okay,” I whispered, as if talking to a skittish animal. “Okay.”

I decided I would leave in the morning. Dawn would make this look less dramatic. The storm would have passed. The room would be just a room. I would gather my bag, walk downstairs, and laugh about it with June. I would be able to tell myself it had all been a story, a close call I had managed with calm.

I held onto that plan the way you hold onto a rail in a rough sea. It was thin, but it was something.

The storm surged again, a sudden gust that made the shutters thump. The beam above me answered with a sharp, splintering crack, louder than any before. The sound went through me like a shock. The bed jerked. Dust rained down in a thick, choking cloud. I covered my face and coughed.

When the dust settled, the room was darker, the air heavier. I could not tell what had changed, only that something had.

I sat up, throat raw, and listened for the next sound.
