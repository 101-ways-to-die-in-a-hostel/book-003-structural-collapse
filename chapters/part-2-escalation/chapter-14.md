# Chapter 14: The Reopening

The first nail I heard was in the morning, a small metallic tap that made my stomach behave like it knew the sound of hammers.

I was in Seguro, under the safe ceiling, when the sound traveled through the courtyard and into the 1920s wing. It wasn't loud, but it was precise, a single, definitive note in the middle of a chorus of hostel noises: water boiling for coffee, sandals scuffing tiles, a French girl complaining about the Wi-Fi. The tap cut through it all like a fingernail on glass.

For a few seconds I lay still, pretending the sound was something else. A spoon in a mug. A token dropped on the floor. A small bird pecking at something outside. Then it came again, followed by another, a staccato rhythm that could only be the sound of someone trying to make the old wing look less old.

I sat up, my hair a mess, my mouth tasting of cheap rum and a night of half-sleep. The safe room looked blank as always, a page that refused to hold my words. The light was clean and responsible. The floor was level. The air smelled like detergent and damp socks. My backpack sat at the foot of the bed like a dog that had been told to stay.

Outside, the courtyard was already awake. The broken fountain had been coaxed into a weak trickle. Marta was mopping, her jaw set, her cross glinting in the morning light. She looked at me and glanced toward the heritage wing, then back, as if to ask whether I could hear it too.

I could. I could hear someone up there, and the thought made my chest tighten with a strange, guilty excitement. Repairs. The word meant permission. It meant reopening. It meant an official stamp on the story I couldn't stop writing.

I brushed my hair into a ponytail and walked out into the courtyard in sandals and a band t-shirt, my glasses sliding down my nose. The sun had come back with the arrogance of a bully. The heat was already thick, the kind that collects on your upper lip and turns your patience into sweat. The air smelled of wet stone and burnt coffee.

Carlos was by the reception desk, his phone wedged between shoulder and ear. He looked up when he saw me, held up a finger to say one minute, then said something in Spanish that sounded like no and not yet. He hung up, ran a hand through his hair, and grimaced.

"They're sending a guy," he said. He nodded toward the heritage wing. "Not the inspector. A contractor. My uncle wants 'repairs.'"

He made air quotes with his fingers, the word repairs dressed up in sarcasm like a costume.

"Is it closed or open?" I asked.

He looked at me, and I felt the weight of his answer in his eyes before he said it. "Officially closed," he said. "But if it looks fixed, it can be open. That is what he thinks." He paused. "I told him to keep it closed. He said the bank doesn't care about my feelings." He tried to smile. It didn't land.

I nodded, unsure what to say. It felt like a conversation I wasn't supposed to be part of, like overhearing an argument between parents and then being asked to choose a side. I wanted to say it should stay closed. I wanted to say I understood why it wouldn't.

"Are you going up?" he asked, his voice careful.

I didn't answer immediately. The hammer tapped again upstairs, and my body leaned toward the sound before my mind could catch up.

"Maybe later," I said.

"Please wait," he said. "At least until they finish. There is dust." It was the kind of practical warning he knew I would accept, because it didn't sound like fear.

"Okay," I said. I meant it for now.

June came into the courtyard with her hair still wet from a shower, a towel around her shoulders. She took one look at me and then at the heritage wing and sighed.

"You're thinking about it," she said.

"I'm thinking about a lot of things," I said, which was true and unhelpful.

"It's like a bad relationship," she said. "It stops texting and you finally feel free, and then it sends you a picture of its cat and you're back in." She took a sip of coffee and watched me over the rim. "That's you and that room, except the cat is a crack and it might kill you." 

I laughed, because it was absurd and because I deserved it. Dark humor tasted like coffee in this heat.

"I just want to see what they're doing," I said.

"That's what you said last time," she said. "And the time before. Just promise me you won't go up there alone." 

"I won't," I said, knowing full well that promises were the currency I used to buy time.

The hammering continued all morning. It was intermittent, a nail every few minutes, a sound that made it impossible to forget the shape of the room above. I sat in the courtyard and tried to read, but the words kept sliding into the rhythm of the taps. Tap. Sentence. Tap. An echo in my brain.

At noon, the contractor finally emerged. He was a short man in a faded Barcelona jersey, a tool belt heavy at his waist. His hands were white with plaster. He wiped his forehead with the back of his arm, leaving a smear of white across his skin.

"Todo listo," he said to Carlos. All ready.

Carlos hesitated, then nodded. The contractor walked out through the courtyard, trailing a faint cloud of dust and the smell of wet cement. The hammering stopped, leaving a sudden hole in the soundscape. The silence felt like a test.

Carlos looked at me. "It is not really fixed," he said.

"What did he do?" I asked.

"He filled the cracks. He put new plaster. It looks nicer." He paused, his mouth flattening. "It looks like it did before the storm." 

"That's... something," I said.

"It is something," he said. "It is not enough." 

He pulled a small keyring from his pocket and held it out to me. The key to the heritage wing hung there, metal dull with use. He didn't offer it, not really. He let it glint in the sun like a question.

"We will open it for tonight," he said. "My uncle will be happy. You can stay in Seguro. You should stay in Seguro." 

The key felt warm when I took it, as if it had been holding his body heat. I slid it into my pocket and felt its weight there, heavy as a coin.

"I'm not sure yet," I said.

Carlos nodded. He didn't argue. He looked tired, as if he had already had this conversation with his uncle and lost. He turned back to the reception desk, the small gesture of surrendering to a day that would keep asking the same question.

June watched me slip the key into my pocket. "You don't need that," she said.

"I know," I said, and we both knew that wasn't the same as not wanting it.

By late afternoon, the hostel had filled with the sound of new arrivals and old routines. The courtyard was a patchwork of hammocks and backpacks. The fountain had stopped again, either from lack of water or lack of will. The heat softened into a humid haze. Someone was cooking garlic and onions in the kitchen, and the smell cut through the mildew like a promise.

A couple arrived from Medellin, their backpacks still wet. They were in their late twenties, sleek in the way locals always seem when you're sweating into your shirt. Carlos explained the rooms in Spanish, gesturing to the modern wing. They asked about the heritage wing, curiosity edging their voices. I watched from the common room, my notebook open but blank.

Carlos hesitated. "Es mas rustico," he said. More rustic. He hesitated again, then added, "Tiene historia." It has history. He glanced at me, then back at them. The woman smiled, the kind of smile that says yes to history. The man shook his head, just a fraction, a private veto.

"No," he said. "Mejor no." Better not.

The woman shrugged and nodded, the decision made without drama. Carlos led them to Seguro. The heritage wing remained, for now, open and empty, a room waiting like a mouth without teeth.

I watched them disappear down the hall and felt a thin, bitter twist in my chest. It wasn't jealousy, exactly. It was the feeling of being the only one who wanted something that might hurt. It made me feel special and stupid in equal measure.

June came over and sat beside me, her hair still damp from the heat. She leaned her elbow on the table and looked at my notebook.

"You haven't written anything," she said.

"I'm thinking," I said.

"That's the problem," she said.

She nudged my notebook with her knuckle. "Write about the safe room. Write about being bored. That's also a story. It's just not a dramatic one." 

"It's not the one I came for," I said.

"Maybe the one you need," she said, and there was a gentleness in her voice that made me feel like a child being handed a coat.

I closed my notebook. The page was empty, the way safe ceilings are empty. It made me want to fill it with something dangerous.

That evening, the sky turned a bruised gray. The radio in the kitchen crackled with weather updates. More rain, another system swirling off the coast, not a hurricane but enough to make the city hold its breath. The air smelled metallic, like coins and wet iron. The humidity pressed down, making the walls feel closer.

Carlos posted a printed notice by the reception desk: STORM WARNING. It was in English and Spanish, the letters bold, the paper slightly curled from the damp. It looked official in a way that felt performative.

I felt my phone buzz with another message from my mother. I didn't read it right away. I could guess its shape. I could hear her voice in the vibration. I left the phone face down on the table and focused on the sky, which was darkening like a bruise spread across a body.

At sunset, the light became dramatic, a last flare of gold against the coming rain. People took photos. I did too. The irony of capturing a beautiful sky before a storm that might knock down a building was not lost on me. I saved the photo and didn't post it. I wasn't sure which version of myself I wanted to be that evening: the one who shares, or the one who keeps.

June and Ana went out to find dinner. They asked if I wanted to join. I said I was tired. It was half true. The other half was a pull toward the room upstairs, the one I'd been circling for days, the one that now, officially, could be mine again.

The key in my pocket felt warm against my thigh, a constant reminder. The waiver I'd signed sat somewhere in Carlos's folder, my name anchoring me to a choice I hadn't fully made.

When the courtyard emptied, I stood and walked toward the heritage wing. The hallway was dim, cooler than the courtyard, the air thick with the smell of wet plaster. The tape was gone. The handwritten sign said OPEN. The letters were uneven, the marker bleeding slightly into the paper. It looked like a promise written by a child.

The stairs creaked as I climbed. My hand slid along the banister, slick with humidity. At the landing, the air changed. The smell was stronger up here: mildew, old wood, a faint sweetness of damp adobe. It was like stepping into a room that had been holding its breath.

My door opened easier now, the swollen frame shaved by the contractor's work. Inside, the room looked cleaner, almost normal. Fresh plaster blurred the crack, hiding its jagged edges beneath a pale smear. It was like putting concealer on a bruise.

The ceiling was the same height but looked higher because it was smooth again. The beam above, though, still looked dark, the wood swollen and wet. The mosquito net hung in a quiet drape. The bed still leaned toward the outer wall, its legs sunk a fraction into the softened floor.

I touched the plaster where the crack had been. It was cool and slightly damp, not yet fully dried. When I pressed lightly, it gave a fraction, like a scab that hadn't hardened. My finger left a faint mark. I wiped it on my pants.

I sat on the bed. It groaned. The mattress smelled faintly of mildew and rain. I thought about the safe room downstairs, the firm mattress, the clean sheets. I thought about June's face when she saw me come up here. I thought about the hammering that had made this room look new again, the audacity of it, the way a cosmetic fix can be mistaken for safety if you're tired enough to believe.

My phone buzzed again. I pulled it out. My mother: "Weather warning. Are you in the safe room? Please tell me." 

The word safe glared at me. I typed, "Yes, in Seguro. The old wing is closed now. I'm fine." It wasn't true. It was a version of the truth I wanted to be true. I hit send and felt the familiar sting of guilt, like a pebble under my toe.

I opened my notebook and wrote by the fading light.

They patched the crack like you patch a wall in a rented flat you plan to leave. It looks better, which is the problem. The danger is the same, but now it is polite. I like the feeling of sitting in a room that has been bandaged. It makes me feel brave and stupid. I cannot tell the difference.

I paused and listened. The building made small noises, a series of clicks and soft groans as the humidity shifted. Outside, a gust of wind pushed against the shutters, making them rattle in a brief fit. The room smelled of damp plaster and old wood. A gecko chirped somewhere in the wall, a tiny sound like a laugh.

I lay back and stared at the ceiling. The fresh plaster looked smooth, almost bored. It didn't catch the light the way the cracked surface had. It didn't offer any metaphors. The beam above it looked darker in the dim, a long shadow of wood that had held too much history.

I told myself I'd go back down before dark. I told myself I'd just stay up here until June and Ana returned, then I could say I'd only been writing. I told myself that the storm warning didn't mean anything yet. I told myself I was in control.

Outside, thunder murmured in the distance. The building answered with a slow, low creak, as if responding to a call. I could feel it in the mattress, a faint vibration under my ribs. I felt a thrill, a small electric pulse that was part fear, part pride. This was what I had wanted: the feeling of being in a story, of being close to the edge without going over.

In the hallway, someone walked by, footsteps quick, then disappeared. The sound was a reminder that I wasn't alone, that the building wasn't a private stage. Still, the room felt like it belonged to me in a way the safe room never did.

The rain began around eight, a soft patter that grew into a steady drum. The shutters rattled again. The smell of wet earth rose through the cracks in the walls, the air cooling as if the building were sweating. The new plaster glistened in the dim light, a sheen of moisture that made it look freshly painted.

I should have gone downstairs then. I didn't. I set my phone on the bed and turned on the flashlight to write, the beam cutting a small circle of light in the room. The mosquito net shimmered like a ghost in the narrow cone. The rest of the room fell away into shadow.

The pen moved faster as the rain intensified.

It is raining again. The building is taking it like an old boxer, standing in the corner while the younger weather throws punches. I want to believe in its endurance, in the idea that four hundred years counts for something. Maybe it counts for the fact that it has been hit before, and is therefore easier to hit now.

I stopped. The pen hovered. The sound of the rain was loud enough to drown my breathing. My headlamp of a phone light made dust particles swirl in the air, dancing in the beam. The room seemed to pulse with the storm, as if the ceiling and my chest were sharing a rhythm.

I shifted on the bed. The frame groaned. The floor beneath it gave a fraction, a soft, tired sink. The sensation was small, but it made my stomach drop. I pressed my heel to the wood and felt it yield slightly, like a step on wet sand. The bed had sunk deeper since yesterday. The patching hadn't fixed that. It had only erased the evidence on the ceiling.

I stood and walked to the wall, pressing my palm against the plaster. It was cooler now, damp. I could feel a slight draft through it, a whisper of outside air. The wall felt like a thin skin stretched over bones that were tired.

In the courtyard below, a candle flickered, then went out as someone closed a door. The hostel felt quieter, the storm keeping people indoors. I could hear the rain on the shutters, the wind pushing against the building in slow, insistent waves. Every time the wind hit, the beam above me answered with a tiny creak, a small protest.

I told myself it was normal. Old wood complains. Old buildings make noise. The rationalizations arrived like loyal pets, even when I didn't call them. I fed them anyway.

My phone buzzed with a message from June. "Where are you?" 

I stared at it. I considered telling the truth. I considered telling a version of the truth. I typed, "In the common room. Be back soon." I sent it before I could think better of it. I was getting used to lying in small, precise ways.

The wind rose again, stronger this time. The shutter rattled in its frame, a stutter of wood on wood. The beam above made a longer groan, the sound like a ship in a harbor. Dust drifted down and landed on my notebook. I brushed it off and watched the particles fall. They looked like tiny flakes of light. It was beautiful, in a dangerous way.

I thought about going downstairs. I even stood with my bag in hand. Then the rain eased for a moment, and the room felt calmer, as if it were asking me to stay. I put the bag back on the bed and sat down, feeling the frame bend under me. It was a small surrender. It felt like a choice.

---

Sometime after midnight, the power flickered. The bare bulb on the ceiling winked once, twice, and then died. The room dropped into darkness. My phone's flashlight was the only light, a thin white cone that made the edges of the room seem farther away. Outside, the storm had grown teeth. The rain hit the shutters with a harder, more insistent rhythm. The wind howled, a long, low sound that made the whole building feel like it was exhaling.

I lay on my back and listened. The mattress was damp now, a cold seeping through the sheet. The mosquito net hung above me like a veil in a funeral. The patched ceiling looked flat and innocent in the beam, a smooth surface hiding whatever was happening above it. My chest tightened with a familiar mix of fear and exhilaration.

I told myself I would go down as soon as the rain eased. I told myself I would go down if I heard anything truly alarming. I told myself my body would warn me if I were in real danger. I told myself I wasn't the kind of person who ignored obvious threats. Then I listened to the storm and let the idea of danger become a story again.

The building shifted, a slow, heavy movement that traveled through the floorboards. I felt it in my teeth. The bed frame rattled. A faint, fine shower of plaster dust drifted down from the ceiling, even though the crack was covered now. It settled on my pillow like a soft, white ash.

I sat up. The room swayed just enough to make my stomach turn. It was slight, the kind of movement you could blame on your own balance. I placed my hand flat on the bed and felt the frame quiver. I pressed my palm to the wall and felt it vibrate with each gust.

The rain intensified. The wind rose. The sound was enormous, a wall of water and air pressing against the shutters. The room groaned, a long complaint from the beam above. I could hear something else now, a faint ticking, like small sticks being bent one by one. It was irregular, not a rhythm, but a series of small, sharp sounds, like a clock that couldn't keep time.

I told myself it was the shutters. I told myself it was a branch outside. I told myself anything that did not involve the beam.

My phone buzzed again. A text from my mother. I didn't open it. I couldn't let her voice into the room. It would make the fear real, and I wasn't ready for that.

The floor under the bed creaked. It was deeper now, a lower pitch. The bed frame sagged another fraction. I slid my hand under the mattress and felt the cold metal of the frame, slick with humidity. It felt like touching something tired.

I thought about the waiver, the second signature, the way my name looked so confident on the page. I thought about my future self reading my journal, seeing these words, deciding whether they were brave or stupid. I thought about how much of my fear was about the room and how much was about the story I needed to tell.

A loud crack split the air, sharp and sudden. I jerked upright, my heart a single hard beat. The sound was above me, not outside. The beam groaned, a long, agonized exhale. Dust rained down, thicker this time, a soft cloud that made me cough.

I froze. The room felt tilted, or maybe I was. The air was thick with dust and rain. The new plaster, which had looked so smooth hours ago, now bore a thin line, a new crack blooming through the patch like a bruise through makeup. It ran along the same path as the old one, a dark line splitting the white.

There it was again, the evidence, the truth sneaking back through the repair. I watched it widen as the wind hit, a tiny, almost imperceptible movement. The building was talking, and I could no longer pretend it was poetry.

I swung my legs over the side of the bed and stood. The floor gave under my feet. It wasn't dramatic. It was just enough to make me feel the softness, the tiredness of the boards. The door was across the room, just a few steps away. I could go now. I could leave. I could choose the safe room and the boring ceiling and still have a story about the night I almost stayed.

Instead I stood there, my phone light shaking in my hand, staring at the new crack. The wind howled again, and the beam answered with a low, wet groan. The plaster line shivered. The bed creaked behind me as if it wanted to move too.

I took one step toward the door. The room shuddered, a small tremor, the kind of movement you feel more than hear. Somewhere above, wood splintered with a sound like a throat clearing.

I stopped. My breath came short, the air thick with dust. My mouth tasted of plaster. I could hear the storm outside, the water pouring like a waterfall. I could hear my own heart, fast and stupid.

In the hallway, a voice called my name, muffled by the door. "Emma?" June. Her voice sounded far away, as if she were calling from underwater.

I looked at the door. I looked at the ceiling. I looked at the new crack, the thin dark line cutting through the fresh plaster. The room felt smaller now, the ceiling closer, the air denser. The building had shifted again, a slow, heavy movement that settled into the bones.

"Just a minute," I said, and the words came out thin.

Another crack sounded above, softer than the last but more intimate, like something breaking in a room where you are trying to sleep. The ceiling trembled. Dust fell in a thin stream onto my bed, onto my notebook, onto the phone light in my hand.

I backed toward the door. The floor sighed under my weight. The wind hit the shutters again, a heavy shove. The beam answered with a groan that felt like a warning.

June knocked again, harder. "Emma, open up." 

I reached for the door handle. It felt slick in my hand, damp from the humidity. I turned it. The door stuck, swollen. I lifted, as I had been taught, and pulled. It resisted. I pulled harder.

The room shuddered.

The crack above me widened by a hair, the new plaster splitting like a seam in fabric. The sound was small, but it felt enormous in the stillness between thunderclaps.

I pulled again, my shoulder straining. The door gave, just a fraction. I could see the thin line of hallway light through the gap. The air from outside the room was cooler, a breath from safety.

Then, from somewhere above, came a sound like a long, slow tear. Not a crack. Not a groan. A tearing, as if something heavy were deciding to let go.

I froze, hand still on the door, the hallway light a sliver in front of me, the room behind me holding its breath.
