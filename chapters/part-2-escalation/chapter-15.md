# Chapter 15: The Jam

The sound above me was not a crack anymore. It was a tear, the kind you hear when fabric gives up.

For a beat, I stood there with my hand on the door handle, the hallway light a thin blade at my feet. The air in the room felt thicker, as if the building had inhaled. The mosquito net shivered. Dust floated down, slow and lazy, like it had all the time in the world.

June's voice was just outside, muffled by the door. "Emma?"

I should have pulled harder. I should have thrown my shoulder against the wood and forced my way out, dramatic and decisive. Instead I froze, my body full of a waiting silence, like a theater audience holding its breath before a jump scare. The old beam above me groaned again, a wet, wooden sound that felt more like a warning than a complaint.

The room gave a small shudder, a tremor that shook the dust from the mosquito net. I felt it in my teeth. I felt it in my knees. It was not violent. It was something worse: a shifting, a settling, the architecture deciding how it wanted to be.

"Just a second," I said, and my voice sounded far away, like I was calling from underwater.

The tear continued, a long, steady rip. The crack in the plaster split wider, the fresh repair giving way like a cheap bandage. For a second I thought I could see through it. The beam loomed above, dark and swollen, the old wood sweating in the humidity. It looked like a bruise that had been there too long.

June banged the door. "Now, Emma."

I pulled. The door resisted, swollen in its frame. The gap of light stayed thin. I lifted and pulled again, and the frame scraped with a sound like teeth. The door shifted, grudging, and the hallway air slipped in, cooler and clean. I could see June's shoes now, her toes pointed toward me, the posture of someone ready to drag a friend out of a bad decision.

Behind me, the beam gave a deep, tired groan. The ceiling bowed almost imperceptibly, enough to make the light from my phone look strange, warped. Another dusting of plaster fell, soft as flour, landing in my hair and on the sheet. A sliver of plaster peeled away and fluttered down like a white leaf.

Something inside me finally chose the door.

I shoved with my shoulder. The wood gave, and I stumbled into the hallway, the light from outside washing over me. June grabbed my wrist and pulled me away, her grip firm and hot against my skin.

"Are you okay?" she asked, already moving us toward the stairs.

"Yes," I said, and it was true in the small, temporary way that matters when you're trying to make it to the next minute.

We went down fast. The stairs creaked under our weight, every step a complaint. The air thickened as we descended, the smell of mildew and damp plaster following us like a ghost. Behind us, the heritage wing held its breath.

In the courtyard, the storm had turned the night into a low, grumbling animal. Rain hammered the tiles and burst into mist at the fountain. The courtyard lights were on but flickering, the bulbs trembling in their sockets. The broken fountain overflowed, water running over the lip and pooling around the legs of the tables.

June let go of my wrist only when we were under the arch, away from the stairwell. She looked me over, her eyes taking in the dust in my hair, the damp on my shirt, the tightness in my jaw.

"That was stupid," she said.

"I know," I said, because this was not a moment for debate.

"That was almost spectacularly stupid," she added, as if to make sure I understood the category of my stupidity. The corner of her mouth twitched. Even in the middle of a storm, she couldn't resist a small joke.

"Is this the part where you say 'I told you so'?" I asked.

"I'm saving it for your obituary," she said, and the dark humor landed with a shiver.

The courtyard smelled like wet stone and coconut oil, like the building had been washed and still couldn't get clean. Carlos stood in the doorway of the reception area, his face lit by the glow of a phone screen. He was talking to someone in Spanish, his voice low and urgent. When he saw us, he paused and covered the phone with his hand.

"You were up there?" he asked, his eyes already answering.

I nodded, a small motion. He looked at June, then back at me.

"No more," he said. It wasn't a request. It was a father telling a child to stop playing with the edge of a roof.

"I was just leaving," I said.

"Good," he said. He went back to the phone, his voice rising with frustration. I caught words: tormenta, peligro, viejo. Storm. Danger. Old. It sounded like a list of things he was tired of repeating.

June steered me toward the common room. It was full of damp bodies and low voices. People were clustered around their phones, watching weather updates in English and Spanish. The news showed a swirling mass over the sea, the kind of graphic that makes storms look like art. Someone laughed at the irony of a hurricane graphic on a hostel TV that couldn't tune in to anything else. The laugh was thin.

I sank into a plastic chair and felt the tremor in my legs finally settle. The air in the common room was sticky, the windows fogged. The smell of wet clothes and cheap rum was thick enough to taste. Someone had brought a plate of soggy empanadas from earlier. They tasted like regret.

June sat on the floor next to my chair, back against the wall, her knees pulled up. She was close enough that our shoulders touched, and the contact grounded me. I should have thanked her. I didn't, because that would have made the fear a confession.

"Do you still have the key?" she asked.

I touched my pocket. The metal was there, warm against my thigh. It felt ridiculous now, a tiny, ordinary object holding so much argument.

"Yes," I said.

"Give it to Carlos," she said.

"I can't," I said.

"You can," she said. "It's literally in your pocket. That is how pockets work." She was trying to make me laugh. I almost did.

"I need it," I said, and the words sounded like a justification for a habit.

"For what?" she asked. "To go up there again?"

I didn't answer. The storm did, with a loud gust that rattled the shutters and made the lights flicker. The building creaked, a low, prolonged sound that traveled through the walls like a sigh.

Ana came into the common room a few minutes later, her hair damp and her face a little pale. She sat across from me and gave a small, disbelieving shake of her head.

"They said to stay away from the old rooms," she said in Spanish-accented English. "Like it is some haunted house." She laughed, then sobered. "You were there?" She pointed toward my hair. The plaster dust was visible even in the dim light.

"Briefly," I said.

"You are very brave or very..." She searched for the word. "Cabeza dura." Hard head.

"It's more nuanced than that," I said automatically, and even I heard how silly it sounded.

She smiled anyway. "You are always saying that," she said.

Outside, the rain intensified. The courtyard drain gurgled, overwhelmed. A thin stream ran across the tiles, making the floor a shining mirror. The wind pushed rain through the open archways, wetting the back of my neck. The air tasted like metal.

Carlos came in and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. He looked at the assembled guests and made a decision. He cleared his throat.

"Listen," he said, in English this time. "The weather is very bad. The old wing... no. Do not go. The new rooms are safer. If you are in the old wing, you move to the common room or the modern rooms. No extra cost. Please." He looked at me when he said it, because he knew.

A couple of people nodded, relieved to be told what to do. A blond guy with a tank top raised his eyebrows. "Is it actually dangerous?" he asked, as if the idea of danger might be negotiable.

"Yes," Carlos said simply. He didn't embellish. He didn't soften it. The one word dropped into the room like a stone.

People murmured. A woman in a rain jacket said she was glad she'd booked Seguro. Someone else muttered about refunds. I felt a flicker of embarrassment, as if Carlos had announced my private stupidity to the room.

June leaned closer. "Give him the key," she whispered.

I shook my head. "Not yet," I said.

She looked at me like she was watching a slow train wreck she couldn't stop. "You're going to get yourself hurt," she said.

"Probably," I said, and I meant it as a joke, but it sat in the air like a confession.

The power flickered again, then stabilized. For a few seconds, the bulbs hummed too brightly, as if the electricity was trying to push itself through. I watched the light, hypnotized by its stubbornness. I could feel the storm pressing against the building, a constant, heavy hand.

My phone buzzed. Another message from my mother. I unlocked it. "Please tell me you're safe. I can't sleep." The words were calm, the punctuation minimal, but I could hear her worry in the spaces between them.

I typed: "I'm safe. In the newer room. Storm is loud but fine." I stared at the message before sending it, the way you do when you know you're lying and want to pretend you aren't. I sent it anyway. The lie felt like the key in my pocket: small, heavy, mine.

June watched me. "Is that your mum?" she asked.

I nodded.

"Tell her the truth," she said.

"I did," I said, because in the moment, I believed the story I was telling.

The storm continued to build. A man in the corner turned up the volume on his phone, the weather report a low murmur of Spanish warnings. Someone opened a beer, the hiss oddly loud. The power flickered, then went out entirely.

The common room plunged into darkness. For a second, no one moved. Then phones lit up, a constellation of screens. The room filled with the glow of rectangles. It was almost beautiful, the faces lit from below like ghost stories.

"Stay in here," Carlos said, voice raised. He moved through the room with a flashlight, checking the doorways, herding us into the center. "We wait. The power will come back." He said it with the same voice people use to tell children that thunder can't hurt them.

I felt June's shoulder against mine in the dark. The building creaked. Somewhere upstairs, a thump sounded, distant and soft. People looked up instinctively, as if they could see through floors.

"Was that the old wing?" someone asked.

Carlos didn't answer. He turned his flashlight toward the hallway and then away, as if to avoid giving the question a direction.

The rain outside roared. I could hear it battering the shutters, the wind pushing at the building like an insistent visitor. The air smelled of wet wood and sweat. I felt my skin prickle with humidity and fear.

An hour passed, then another. The power came back in a stuttering flicker, and the room exhaled. People stretched, joked about sleeping on the common room floor, made half-hearted plans to move to a hotel in the morning. Someone took a selfie of the candlelight and posted it with a caption about "authentic storm vibes." I almost laughed, then realized how close it was to something I would have posted.

At some point, people started drifting to their rooms. The storm had dulled to a steady assault, less dramatic and more persistent. The air felt thick and tired. Carlos unlocked the modern wing rooms for anyone who needed a bed. He looked at me once, then away.

June stood up and held out her hand. "Come on," she said. "Let's go to Seguro."

"I'm fine," I said.

"You're not," she said, without anger. "You're scared. You're just pretending you're not because it makes you feel special." Her words were sharp, and they landed exactly where they were supposed to.

I wanted to argue. I wanted to say she didn't understand my reasons, my need for something that felt real, my fear of being ordinary. But the storm outside made everything feel too heavy for arguments.

"I'm just going to grab my notebook," I said.

"Now?" she asked.

"It's up there," I said. "In my room. I'll be quick." I could hear the lie before I finished saying it.

"Emma," she said, and the one word held everything she couldn't make me accept.

I stood anyway. The key in my pocket felt like a pulse. I told myself I would go up, take the notebook, and come right back down. I told myself I wasn't going to sleep in that room. I told myself I was in control. I told myself a lot of things.

The hallway was darker than before. The lights had come back, but the heritage wing stairwell was shadowed, the bulbs dimmer there, as if reluctant. The air was cooler up the stairs, damp and still. The smell of wet plaster grew stronger, mixing with the mildewed sweetness of old wood.

Each stair creaked louder now, swollen with water. I kept a hand on the banister, its wood slick beneath my palm. I paused at the landing and listened. The heritage hallway was empty, the doors dark. The drip in the corner had become a stream, water running down the wall like a tear that wouldn't stop.

My door was slightly ajar. I had not left it that way. The gap was narrow, but it was there, a dark mouth waiting.

I pushed it open. The room was colder than the hallway, the air damp and heavy. The crack in the ceiling was wider, the edges frayed. The plaster around it had fallen in thin sheets, leaving a jagged line of exposed lath. The beam looked darker, swollen, its surface glossy with moisture.

My notebook was on the bed where I'd left it. The bed sank in the middle, the legs pressed deeper into the floor. The floorboards were darker there, wet. The mosquito net hung still, a white cage.

I stepped in, and the door scraped against the frame, sticking for a second before giving. The sound was small but telling. The wood was swelling, the frame shifting. I told myself it would open again easily. I told myself I'd only be here a minute.

I grabbed the notebook. It was damp at the edges, the paper already curling. The sight of it made me irrationally angry, as if the building had no right to touch my words.

As I turned to go, the room shuddered. Not hard. Just a brief, sickening movement. The beam above groaned, and a thin shower of plaster dust fell onto my shoulders and the open pages.

I froze. The storm outside raged. The wind shoved the shutters, making them rattle in their frames. The building answered with a deep, slow creak that seemed to travel through the walls like a voice.

I should have left. I didn't. I sat on the edge of the bed, the notebook open, the pencil in my hand. The light from my phone carved out a small circle in the room, isolating me in a pool of brightness while the corners swam in shadow.

Maybe, I thought, I could just write a few lines. Maybe I could capture the feeling of this moment, the weight of it. Maybe that's all I needed to do to let it go.

I wrote:

The room is wet with age. The beam above is sweating. The floor is soft like a bruise. The storm is a fist on the shutters. I feel the building breathe, and I am inside its lungs.

I stopped, because it was melodramatic and true, and I didn't know which was worse. I closed the notebook and stood. I would go down now. I would.

The door didn't open.

I pulled. The door shifted but didn't swing. The swollen frame held it in place. I tried lifting, then pulling, the same trick as before. The wood scraped, the sound like a nail down a violin. The gap opened a hair, then stuck.

The hallway light was a thin line again, a repeat of earlier, but this time the air felt different. The room was heavier now, the humidity thicker. The beam above gave another groan. Dust fell. The mosquito net swayed, though there was no breeze.

"It's fine," I said to myself, because if I didn't say it, the fear would be all that remained. I pulled harder. The door gave a fraction, then stuck again, as if someone outside were holding it.

I leaned my shoulder against the wood and pushed. The door finally creaked open enough for me to slip my arm through. I shoved, the hinge protesting. The frame moaned. The gap widened.

Then the building shifted again, a small, decisive movement. The door jolted in my hand and slammed back toward me, pinching my fingers. I yelped and pulled back. Pain flared, sharp and hot. The door hung there, half open, half closed, the frame squeezing it like a jaw.

I shook my hand and took a breath. The air tasted like dust. I could feel my heart in my throat. The storm outside boomed, a long roll of thunder that shook the walls. In response, the beam above emitted a sound like a slow crack, a low, deep sound that made my stomach drop.

The ceiling did not fall. Not yet. It just sagged, barely perceptible, like a tired face sinking into itself. The plaster line widened by a fraction. Another strip peeled away and drifted down.

I shoved the door again, and this time it moved, grudging, and I slipped through into the hallway, dragging the notebook behind me. The air outside the room felt cooler, a relief. I stood in the hallway and caught my breath, my fingers throbbing. I wanted to laugh. I wanted to cry.

I pulled the door shut behind me, carefully. It stuck even in the last inch. I pushed it closed. It settled with a soft, reluctant click, like a mouth closing on a secret.

At the top of the stairs, I paused. The hallway was empty, the air damp. The dripping in the corner had become a steady trickle. The wind shoved at the building again, and I felt the whole wing sway, just enough to make my stomach turn.

I should have gone down. I did go down, for a while. But the key was still in my pocket, and the room was still upstairs, and the storm was not done.

---

I spent the rest of the night in Seguro, if you can call it rest. The safe room had power, a steady glow that made the storm outside feel distant. The windows rattled, but the walls didn't tremble. The floor didn't soften under my weight. My body wanted to relax and couldn't, as if the tension in the old wing had followed me down.

June fell asleep quickly, her breathing even. I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, its clean, intact surface. It was the same white as the repaired plaster upstairs, but it felt different because I trusted it. That was the problem. Trust is a kind of boredom.

At some point, the storm quieted. The rain became a steady patter instead of a roar. The building stopped groaning as much. I drifted into a shallow sleep and dreamed of cracks that opened like mouths.

In the morning, the courtyard was damp and steaming. The sun was out again, as if the storm had been a prank. Puddles gleamed on the tiles. The broken fountain had overflowed during the night and now trickled lazily, water spilling over its edge like an apology.

Carlos looked exhausted, his eyes red. He had been up all night, I could tell. He was standing by the reception desk with a cup of coffee he wasn't drinking. When he saw me, he nodded once, a tired acknowledgment.

"Any damage?" I asked.

He shrugged. "Some leaks. The roof in the old wing..." He rubbed his temple. "It is worse. The door frames are swollen. The inspector is supposed to come today." He paused, then added, "If he comes."

"Should I move my things?" I asked, as if I were still undecided.

He looked at me. "Yes," he said. He didn't soften it. He didn't try to persuade. It was a statement of fact.

June appeared behind me, her hair wet from a shower. "Good morning," she said to Carlos. He nodded. She turned to me. "Did you sleep?"

"A bit," I said.

"We should get breakfast," she said. "Somewhere not here."

"There's a place with arepas," Ana said, joining us with a smile that seemed too bright for a morning after a storm.

We walked out into the street, the air clean and humid, the city washed and shining. Vendors were already out, calling, their voices rising with the heat. The smell of fried corn and sweet coffee drifted from a stall. The sun made everything look new, as if the night hadn't happened.

Over breakfast, the conversation drifted to the storm, to the way the hostel had felt like a ship, to the noise of the wind. June made a joke about bringing life jackets next time. Ana laughed. I smiled when I was supposed to.

My phone buzzed. A notification: my mother had replied. "Thank you. Please stay safe." I read it and put the phone down. The guilt came as it always did, soft and persistent.

We returned to the hostel around midday. The sun was bright and cruel. The walls of the building gleamed, white and yellow, hiding their cracks under fresh light. The heritage wing looked calm from the courtyard, its shutters closed like eyes.

A man in a crisp shirt and hard hat was standing by the reception desk, clipboard in hand. The inspector. He looked too young for authority, too clean for the building. Carlos was talking to him in rapid Spanish, pointing toward the heritage wing. The inspector nodded, expression neutral.

I hovered in the courtyard, trying to look casual while listening. June nudged me. "Don't," she said.

"I'm not doing anything," I said, which was true if you ignored the part of me leaning toward the conversation.

The inspector walked toward the heritage wing. Carlos followed. The rest of the hostel watched, as if a verdict were about to be read. I felt my stomach tighten with the same sensation I got before exam results, the mix of hope and dread.

They went upstairs. The courtyard held its breath. The fountain dripped. A gecko chirped from somewhere near the roof, a small, stupid sound in a serious moment.

When they came back down, Carlos's face was set. The inspector's expression was professional, a mask of neutral. He spoke to Carlos again, his hand gesturing toward the ceiling as if drawing invisible lines. I caught only fragments: riesgo, soporte, urgente. Risk. Support. Urgent.

Carlos turned to the guests. "The old wing is closed," he said. "No one is allowed. Not tonight. Not tomorrow. It is not safe." He glanced at the inspector, who nodded once, slow. "Please respect this." He looked at me when he said it, and his eyes were exhausted.

A murmur ran through the courtyard. Someone asked about refunds. Someone asked about alternative rooms. The inspector started to leave, heading toward the door, already done with his part. The building itself stood behind us, quiet, as if it were pretending to be innocent.

June looked at me. "It's done," she said.

I nodded. The word closed echoed in my mind like a dare. The wing was closed now, officially, by someone with a clipboard and a hard hat. It should have been enough to end the story. It should have been a relief.

Instead, it felt like someone had taken a book from my hands before I reached the ending.

That afternoon, I packed my bag. I moved my clothes into Seguro. I watched the old key turn into a new one, a different metal shape. I gave the heritage key to Carlos. He held it like it weighed more than it should.

"Thank you," he said, and for a moment his face softened.

"It's temporary," I said, because I couldn't help myself.

He didn't answer. He just took the key and put it behind the desk, out of sight.

By evening, the storm had moved on. The sky was clear, the sunset a dramatic wash of gold and pink. People took photos in the courtyard, the light making the walls glow. The hostel felt normal again, the danger tucked away behind a closed door and a stern notice.

I sat on my bunk in Seguro, the safe ceiling above me, and tried to write. The words wouldn't come. The page stayed blank. The story was upstairs, locked away, behind a door that was no longer mine.

June came in and sat on the bunk below. "You okay?" she asked.

"Yes," I said, and meant it less than ever.

She looked at me. "You should be proud," she said. "You did the smart thing."

"It doesn't feel smart," I said. "It feels like I chickened out."

She laughed softly. "That's the best thing to chicken out of." She nudged the bed frame with her foot. "Your life isn't a caption."

I wanted to tell her she didn't understand. I wanted to tell her that being safe felt like failure. Instead I stared at the blank page and let the silence do the talking.

Later, when the lights went out and the room fell quiet, I slipped out of bed. The hostel was asleep. The courtyard was dark, the fountain silent. The air smelled of night and damp stone.

I walked to the reception desk. The keys hung on hooks behind the counter, labeled in small, careful handwriting. The heritage key was there, the same dull metal, the same weight. It sat like a sentence I hadn't finished.

I looked around. The lobby was empty. I could hear the distant sound of the sea, the low murmur of the city. Somewhere, a dog barked. The building creaked, a quiet settling as it cooled in the night.

My hand hovered, then moved. I took the heritage key from its hook. It was warm, as if it had been waiting.

I slipped it into my pocket and walked back toward the heritage wing, the hallway empty and dim. The closed sign hung on the door, bold and official. I slid the key into the lock and turned it. The latch clicked, soft and final.

Upstairs, the air was cooler, the smell of damp plaster stronger. The hallway was dark, the shutters closed. My footsteps sounded too loud. The heritage door to my room was still there, its frame swollen, its wood rough under my fingers.

I opened it and stepped inside. The room was darker than before, the moonlight thin through the shutters. The crack in the ceiling was a black line now, a seam in the dark. The bed leaned toward the outer wall. The mosquito net hung like a veil.

I closed the door behind me. The latch clicked. The sound was small, but it felt like a decision.

Outside, far off, thunder murmured. The storm was not gone. It was just waiting.

I lay down on the bed and listened to the old building breathe. The floor was soft under the frame. The beam above made a low, wet sound. The crack in the ceiling seemed to widen in the dark, a line pulling itself open.

I told myself I would leave before I slept. I told myself I just wanted to feel the room one more time. I told myself the door would open easily in the morning.

Above me, something shifted, a small, decisive crack. The ceiling gave a faint, inward bow. Dust drifted down like ash.

I held my breath and waited for the next sound.
