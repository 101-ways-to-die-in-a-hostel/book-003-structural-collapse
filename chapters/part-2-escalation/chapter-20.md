# Chapter 20: The Loudest Warning

The crack was so loud it felt like it happened inside my teeth.

Everyone in the common room froze with their cups half-raised and their sleep faces hanging. The sound was not the usual creak, not the patient sigh of old timber. This was sharp, a gunshot in wood, the building announcing itself. The lights flickered. A few drops of water fell from the ceiling and landed on the tiles with tiny, humiliating plinks.

Carlos swore under his breath in Spanish and shot toward the heritage stairwell. June stood up at the same time, her mug sloshing. For a second we moved together, a small stampede of the curious and the anxious.

"Stay here," Carlos said, turning back with his hand up. It was the kind of command you give to children and drunks. He had the same tired face for both.

"We heard it," June said. "Is it the roof?"

He shook his head, then didn't, then grabbed the stairwell door and yanked. It stuck. He pushed his shoulder into it and it opened with a reluctant scrape. The hallway beyond was darker than before, the light bulb still doing that nervous flicker. The smell of wet plaster hit us like a cold towel.

"Not safe," he said, and stepped into the heritage wing anyway.

Of course I followed. I told myself it was because I needed to grab something. I had already grabbed everything important. It was just the older, more stubborn part of me that wanted to see.

June followed too, her hand on the banister, her eyes already narrowed like she was bracing for a punch.

The hallway was damp and slick. The baseboards had a thin line of water along them, an ominous thread. Somewhere in the dark above, water dripped in a steady, patient rhythm. The air tasted like dust and salt. The building was sweating.

Carlos stopped outside my door. He didn't open it right away. He stood there for a moment, listening, his head tilted. The silence pressed against us. Then he pushed the door.

The room looked wrong in the way a face looks wrong when it has been punched in the dark. The ceiling crack had grown into a web, the line now a branching set of veins spreading toward the corners. A strip of plaster had fallen, leaving the lath exposed like ribs. The beam was split in a visible seam, a thin black line running along its length, glossy with water. The mosquito net hung into the empty space where the plaster used to be, its edge dusted white.

The floor had a new slope. It was slight, but you could see it in the way the chair leaned and the way a cup on the table had migrated toward the wall. The bed nearest the window had sunk another inch into the wood. The metal legs looked like they were being swallowed.

The sound had come from here.

"We should move your things," June said quietly. It wasn't a question.

Carlos nodded. "All heritage rooms," he said. "Now. No one sleeps here tonight. No one. The storm comes back tonight. This is done."

The words were exactly what I wanted to hear and exactly what I did not want to accept. They were not a suggestion. They were a verdict.

"Is it... is it safe to be in here at all?" I asked. My voice was thin. I hated that.

Carlos looked at the ceiling, then at me. "It is not safe," he said, and there was nothing performative in it. He sounded exhausted, like he had been saying that sentence for years.

He stepped into the room anyway and grabbed my bag. He lifted it and the bed frame groaned, a complaining, intimate sound. He flinched. I flinched. The sound stuck to the inside of my ribs.

I moved around the room, collecting my sweater, my notebook, the small purse of coins I'd been too lazy to lock away. The floor dipped under me and the plaster dust clung to my socks. The room was not a room anymore. It was a warning.

"Look," I said, and pointed.

On the far wall, a vertical crack had opened from the baseboard to the window frame. It was wide enough to see darkness behind it, a shadow that might have been nothing or might have been a gap. I leaned closer. A tiny breeze touched my cheek through the split. The outside was coming in.

June swore. Carlos made a sound I had never heard him make, half breath, half prayer.

"We go," he said. He did not wait for agreement. He grabbed my bag and turned toward the door.

I lingered a second, just long enough to look back at the bed. The mattress was damp, the mosquito net touched it like a shroud, and the ceiling above bowed with a shallow, visible curve. The beam looked wet and tired. The room was breathing and it was not doing it well.

I followed them out.

In the hallway, the floor tilted toward the outer wall. You could feel it in your ankles. The plaster had blistered and sagged in soft patches, as if the wall were melting. The light bulb flickered and then went out. For a moment we were in gray dark. June's phone light filled the space, the beam trembling.

We descended the stairs carefully. The banister was slick. The stair treads had that spongy give that made you feel you were walking on a mattress. The building groaned with every gust of wind. It was a tired animal complaining about being asked to stand.

Downstairs, people had gathered in a loose cluster near the reception desk, their faces damp and tight. Someone had dragged a mattress into the middle of the room, as if building a moat against the ceiling.

Carlos set my bag down and turned to the group. "The heritage wing is closed," he said, louder this time, in Spanish and English. "You cannot go up. Do not go up. It is dangerous. We will move everyone to the modern rooms or the common room. We will refund if you want to leave."

A man with a beard and a fraying backpack raised his hand, as if in class. "Can we at least get our stuff?" he asked.

"We will get your things," Carlos said. "Do not go."

The man started to argue. Carlos did not. He looked at him with that flat, tired stare and the argument died.

June sat next to me on a mattress. Her hair was damp. She smelled faintly of salt and coffee. She didn't say I told you so. She didn't have to.

"Okay," I said, because I needed to say something. "Okay, so... that was dramatic."

June gave me a look. "You keep calling it dramatic like it's theater."

I stared at my hands. There was plaster dust between my knuckles. "Maybe it is," I said. "Maybe the building just wants an audience."

She laughed once, dry. "If it drops the ceiling, I hope it gets a standing ovation."

The humor landed and then didn't. The sound we had heard was still in my ears, a rifle crack from inside the bones of the building. It was not dramatic. It was physics.

Carlos returned to the desk, phone in hand. He was speaking to someone, his voice low. I could hear the word inspector and another word that sounded like manana. Tomorrow. The word floated in the air, a promise and a threat.

I wondered what it meant for a building to survive on manana.

By late morning the rain had softened into a stubborn drizzle. The courtyard looked rinsed, the tiles gleaming. The air was still thick and warm, the kind of warm that makes wet feel like a second skin. People drifted around with cups of coffee and damp clothes. The common room had become a nest of mattresses and backpacks, a temporary camp.

I checked the weather app again. The storm had not left. It had just stepped back to take a breath. The alert now said, "Strengthening expected." A red band of storm sat offshore like a bruise. The map was deceptively tidy, a swirl of colors that meant nothing about the sound of the crack.

I took my notebook out, not to write but to hold. It was my talisman against feeling stupid. I flicked through the pages, reading my own sentences with the detachment of someone reading a stranger's diary. My handwriting had gotten messier as the week went on, letters tilting, the line of words dipping in the middle like the floor.

"You okay?" June asked.

"Fine," I said. "Just thinking about the logistics of sleeping like this."

She looked around at the bodies slumped on mattresses and chairs. "It feels like a disaster shelter," she said.

"It's very authentic," I said.

She snorted. "You're insufferable when you're scared." She nudged my shoulder with hers, a gentler version of the banter we had been practicing like a dance.

I smiled. It didn't quite reach my mouth.

At noon, Carlos returned with a stack of sheets and directed people to the modern dorms. There weren't enough beds for everyone, so some of us would sleep in the common room. The idea of sleeping below the heritage wing, under the same sagging beams, felt like sharing a table with a shark and calling it compromise.

I hovered near the reception desk, listening. Carlos had a phone pressed to his ear, his voice short and tired. The word inspector came up again. "He says tomorrow," he said to the person on the other end. "But the storm..." He listened, sighed, and then said something I didn't catch. He looked up and met my eye, and I looked away.

I could go to another hostel. There were dozens in the city. I could book a hotel with my father's credit card and text him a vague apology. The idea felt like defeat. It felt like becoming the version of myself I had come here to outgrow.

Maybe that was arrogance. Maybe it was fear dressed up as principle. It was hard to tell the difference when the rain was loud.

After lunch, I told June I was going upstairs to get my toiletries. It was a lie in the way most of my lies were: part true, part convenient. I wanted to see the room in daylight. I wanted to see if the crack had grown, if the beam had shifted. I wanted to know what it looked like to stand in the place I was not supposed to be.

"Don't," she said.

"I just need my toothbrush," I said.

"Use mine," she said.

That should have ended it. It didn't.

I waited until she went to the kitchen and then slipped toward the heritage stairwell. The door was shut now. A handwritten sign was taped to it: NO ENTRAR / DO NOT ENTER. The letters were bold and shaky. The tape was already peeling at one corner, the humidity attacking even the warning.

I pulled the door open anyway. The frame stuck. The door made a low groan as it moved. The hallway beyond was dim. The light bulb was out, the wire hanging from the ceiling like a broken nerve. I turned on my phone flashlight. The beam caught damp plaster and a new dusting of white on the floor.

The air was cooler up there, heavy with mildew. My footsteps sounded too loud. The building felt empty in a way that made it more alive.

At the top of the stairs, I stopped. The hallway had changed. The floor slanted more than it had this morning. The boards were warped, their seams darkened with water. A crack in the wall near the bathroom had widened, its edges crumbling like wet bread. The smell was sharper, a mix of rot and something metallic.

I moved carefully toward my door. The wood had swollen and the frame was tighter. It opened with effort, the edge scraping against the jamb.

Inside, the room was dim even with the flashlight. The daylight from the shutters was a weak gray. The ceiling crack had widened again. In one corner, the plaster had fallen completely, leaving the lath exposed in a jagged rectangle. The beam above the bed looked like it had split a fraction more, the seam darker, the wood fibers visible like torn cloth.

On the far wall, the vertical crack had become a gap. It was wide enough now to slide two fingers into. I did. My fingertips touched air and then something cold and wet. I pulled my hand back and stared at the dust on my skin, a ghost of the wall.

I leaned closer and peered through the gap. A sliver of daylight showed me the outside: gray sky, rain streaking down, a strip of yellow wall across the alley. The building was literally opening to the weather.

I should have walked out right then. I should have taken the warning at face value and gone downstairs and spent the night on a plastic chair like everyone else. Instead I stood there and let the gap make a story in my head.

"Buildings breathe," I murmured. The words sounded thin and ridiculous in the damp room.

I took a photo of the crack, because of course I did. It was habit now, to turn danger into content. I didn't post it. I just saved it in my drafts, as if I were collecting evidence for a future version of myself who might need to prove she had been brave.

My toothbrush was in my bag. I grabbed it and tossed it into my pocket, the world's most practical excuse.

As I turned to leave, a small piece of plaster fell from the ceiling and hit my shoulder. It wasn't heavy, just a flake, like a fingernail clipping. I brushed it off and felt the tiniest shiver of fear run along my spine. The room was shedding.

The door behind me creaked. I froze, then realized it was the wind pressing at the shutters, the building flexing under the breeze. The sound made me think of a ship creaking at sea. The difference was that ships are supposed to move.

I walked to the window and touched the shutter. The wood was damp and soft. The rain outside was steady now, not violent, just persistent. I could hear the street below, muffled, a vendor calling out something about mangoes. Life outside was normal. The building was not.

I closed the shutter and turned toward the door. The floor dipped under my heel, a small, nauseating give. It felt like stepping on a sponge.

When I got back into the hallway, I paused. The wall seemed to lean. I imagined the building like a tired person, slumping slowly to one side. The thought made me both sympathetic and afraid.

I was halfway down the stairs when I heard a voice above me.

"Emma!"

June. The sound of her footfalls in the hallway was quick and angry. She appeared at the top landing, hair pulled back, a damp towel around her shoulders like a cape.

"What are you doing?" she said.

"Getting my toothbrush," I said, and held it up like proof.

She stared at it. The stare was a weight. "You're unbelievable," she said. "You can buy a toothbrush."

"I like mine," I said.

She took a breath. "Do you want to die in there?"

The question landed hard. It was too blunt, too honest. It made everything else in the air go quiet.

"No," I said. "Obviously not."

"Then stop acting like it doesn't matter." Her voice broke at the end, a thin crack like the sound in the ceiling. She looked away, blinking too fast.

I wanted to tell her I wasn't brave. I wasn't even sure I was stubborn. I was just not ready to let go of the idea that this could be a good story.

"It's just old," I said, which was the same excuse I had been repeating for days. "Old things... settle."

"Old things die," she said. "And they take people with them sometimes."

She came down the stairs and stood next to me, closer than she had before. She looked tired. We all did. The storm had wrung something out of us, a thin rope of nerves.

"Please," she said. "Sleep down here tonight."

I nodded. I meant it in the moment.

We went back to the common room together. The smell of coffee and damp laundry hit me like a blanket. Carlos was moving between guests with a clipboard, assigning beds like a flight attendant. Marta had placed a bucket under a leak in the ceiling. The drip in the bucket was a slow, mocking metronome.

"You went up," Carlos said when he saw me. It was not a question.

"Just to get my toothbrush," I said.

He stared at me in the same tired way. "No more."

"Okay," I said.

The afternoon dragged. The rain took a break and the sky turned a pale, exhausted blue. People wandered out to buy food, to get some air. The street smelled of fried oil and wet stone. The sun was a brief, arrogant flash. The storm was gathering its breath.

I sat in the courtyard with my notebook and tried to write. The page stayed blank. The sound of the fountain's trickle, the sound of the wind in the bougainvillea, the smell of mildew and mangoes, all of it felt too present to pin down. It was like trying to write inside a storm.

In the late afternoon, Carlos announced that the storm was expected to intensify again after dark. "We will close the front door at ten," he said. "Please stay inside."

People nodded. A few rolled their eyes. The drama of a storm was already becoming inconvenient, the way real danger does.

I called my mother. The call went to voicemail. I hung up and stared at the phone for a long time. I could picture her in the kitchen, chopping vegetables, the radio on low. I could picture myself telling her about the crack in the ceiling and the gap in the wall and Carlos's tired face. I could picture her telling me to get out.

I didn't leave a message.

The sun set behind a thick wall of cloud. The air turned heavy again, damp and electric. The first gusts came in hot and impatient. The shutters in the courtyard rattled. The bougainvillea shook. The storm was back at the door.

We ate dinner in the common room, a sad pile of arroz con huevo and plantains from a nearby stall. June and Ana sat with me. Mark the Canadian joined us and told a story about a hostel in Guatemala with a toilet that backed up into the shower. We laughed, because laughter was easier than fear.

"You really are going to stay down here, right?" June asked as she stood to clear her plate.

"Yes," I said.

I meant it. I did. I wanted to be the person who listened, who chose safety when it was offered. I wanted to stop being at war with my own common sense.

After dinner, people laid out their mattresses. The common room turned into a field of sleeping bodies and whispering phones. The lights were dimmed. Someone played soft music from a tinny speaker, a slow salsa that felt like a lullaby.

I lay on a mattress near the wall with my backpack as a pillow. The air was warm and wet. The storm hissed outside. The sound of it was constant, a white noise that should have been soothing. It wasn't.

I closed my eyes. I thought about the room above, the crack in the ceiling, the gap in the wall. I thought about the way the floor had dipped under my feet. I thought about the way the building had sounded when it cracked, like a tooth breaking.

I opened my eyes.

The common room was full of people, but it felt lonely in a way my room never did. There was no privacy, no sense of being inside my own narrative. I felt like a refugee from my own choices.

I sat up and looked at the heritage stairwell door. The sign still hung there, the tape curling. The door was shut, a line of wood between me and the room.

I told myself I would stay on the mattress. I told myself I would sleep. I told myself I was done with foolishness.

Then my phone buzzed. A notification from Instagram: "Your draft is ready." It was the cracked ceiling photo, still waiting. The little red circle felt like a dare.

I stood up.

The decision felt small, like standing up to get a glass of water. It wasn't. It was a pivot. I knew it and pretended I didn't.

I walked to the stairwell door. The hallway beyond was dark. The storm outside made the courtyard shutters bang, and the sound made the door vibrate under my hand. The sign said DO NOT ENTER. I entered.

Up the stairs, the air cooled and the smell thickened. My phone flashlight shook as I climbed. The building creaked in long, deep groans with each gust of wind, a low animal sound that raised the hairs on my arms. The hallway was darker now, the light bulb still dead. My footsteps were swallowed by the soft, wet wood.

My door was harder to open. The frame had swollen again. I had to shoulder it. It gave with a reluctant scrape and then stuck halfway. I pushed. The door swung in with a sigh.

The room was darker than before. The wind had shifted the shutters so that only a thin strip of light came in. The crack in the ceiling was wider. The split in the beam was visible without the flashlight now, a dark seam like a cut. The gap in the wall had grown, a thin slice of outside, rain streaking down the neighboring wall.

The sound of the storm was louder up here, closer, as if the building were amplifying it. The room smelled of wet wood and damp plaster. The floor felt softer, as if the room were trying to become a swamp.

I set my bag on the bed. The frame groaned. The metal legs sank another fraction into the wood. It was the loudest warning yet, the bed itself telling me it didn't trust the floor.

I sat anyway.

There is a kind of stubbornness that feels like bravery until the moment it doesn't. I was practicing that kind of stubbornness. I told myself I would stay just long enough to write a page, to prove that I was not afraid of my own story.

I opened my notebook. The pen hovered. The storm hit the shutters hard enough to make them slap against the frame. The room shivered. Dust drifted from the ceiling and landed on the page like fine ash.

I wrote: The building is a body, and I am sleeping under its ribs.

I underlined ribs and then stopped. The phrase felt too true. I closed the notebook.

I lay back on the bed and turned on my headlamp. The beam cut through the damp air, illuminating the dust. The mosquito net hung above me like a lazy spiderweb. The bed felt damp and cold. The room breathed around me, the sound of the storm threading through the cracks.

A loud gust hit the building, and the beam above me groaned, a sound that felt too close to splitting. I held my breath without meaning to.

The storm was not at its peak yet. It was only gathering speed. Outside, the city was battening down, the vendors pulling tarps over their carts, the streets emptying. Inside, I was under a ceiling that had already admitted it was tired.

I told myself I could leave if it got worse. I told myself I would hear the warning and go. I told myself I was in control.

The building answered with a long, deep creak that ran along the beam like a finger sliding across a spine.

I turned the page of my book and pretended that was normal.

The wind rose again, a louder, angrier howl, and the room shook. Dust rained down in a soft, steady curtain. The crack above me widened by a fraction, a tiny movement I could feel more than see.

I did not move.

When the next sound came, I would still be here to hear it.
