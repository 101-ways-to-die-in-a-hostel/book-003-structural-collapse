# Chapter 13: The Temporary

The safe ceiling was a blank page, and I couldn't stop trying to write on it.

I woke to the sound of someone sweeping the courtyard, the soft scratch of bristles on tile. The light that slipped through the Seguro window was clean and unproblematic, the kind of light you could trust. It fell in a square across the floor, and in it the dust motes hung politely, not swarming the way they did upstairs. The mattress had held my body without sagging, and my back felt odd, like I'd slept on a board rather than in a bed.

The room smelled of detergent and damp socks. It smelled like any cheap hostel on earth. It had no opinion about me.

I lay there for a moment and listened to the building. There was no groan. No long creak. Just the distant drip of the courtyard fountain that had restarted itself, stubborn as a habit, and the occasional cough from someone in the bunk across the room. The storm had passed and taken the drama with it. It was almost insulting.

I sat up and looked at June in the bunk above me. She was sprawled like a question mark, hair in her face, an arm dangling toward the floor. She had the gift of being able to be unconscious without being embarrassed about it. I swung my legs over the side and put my feet on the tile. The floor was level. I hated it for that.

In the courtyard, Carlos was already at the reception desk, a mug of coffee in his hand. He looked like he'd slept in his clothes. The shirt had lines at the elbows from sleeping on a chair. He nodded at me when I passed, the nod of someone who is keeping count of everyone's choices.

"Morning," he said.

"Morning," I said, and meant it in the exhausted way people do after the weather has tried to kill them.

He motioned toward the hall leading to the heritage wing. A length of plastic tape had been strung across the opening, yellow against the white walls. It said PELIGRO in black letters. It was dramatic and cheap, the kind of tape used for everything from building sites to broken pool gates. It fluttered when the courtyard breeze wandered through.

"Closed," he said.

"Just for today?" I asked, already knowing the answer would be something like yes and no.

"Until the inspector returns," he said. "Until we can be sure." He looked at me when he said sure, like he was giving me permission to disagree.

"Is the inspector coming back?" I asked.

He shrugged. "He said he would. Sometimes they say that." He took a sip of coffee, the kind of sip that was more ritual than taste. "Better if no one goes in there. Please, Emma." The last word was soft and rough at the same time.

I nodded because I didn't want to argue, not this early, not with that tape between us.

June joined me in the courtyard a few minutes later, her hair twisted up, a banana in her hand. She caught my gaze on the tape and raised her eyebrows.

"Good," she said. "It needed a sign." She took a bite of banana and spoke around it. "It's like the building was on the verge of saying something and now it has a translator."

"It doesn't feel closed to me," I said.

"That's because you romanticize closed doors," she said, and I laughed even though it felt too true.

The morning was humid but bright. The street vendors outside the hostel had returned, voices rising with the heat. A man pushed a cart of arepas past the doorway, the smell of fried corn and oil sliding in over the mildew. In the courtyard, Ana was on a video call with someone who looked like a mother on a small screen, a familiar domestic scene that made me feel like a trespasser. I sat on the edge of the fountain and watched water leak from a crack in the stone basin, the water glinting like it wanted to be somewhere else.

My phone buzzed with a notification. I opened Instagram without thinking. The photo of the crack I'd taken yesterday sat in my drafts, its thumbnail a jagged line of dark across pale plaster. The app prompted me again to share it. It was as if the algorithm knew the crack was the only interesting thing about my week.

I typed a caption in my notes: "Safety is a modern invention." It sounded ridiculous, which is why I liked it. I imagined the comments from friends, the little red hearts from people who had never stood under a ceiling that might fall. I imagined my mother seeing it and feeling her chest tighten across the ocean. I deleted the caption and put the phone in my pocket.

The day stretched out like a hammock. People planned island trips and salsa lessons as if the storm had been a rumor. I joined June and Ana for breakfast, the hostel's bread too dry, the coffee too sweet, the mango perfect. We sat at a table under the broken fountain, the water occasionally dripping into our cups if we weren't careful. The talk was the usual mix of where to go and how much things cost, the kind of conversation that is meant to erase the idea of danger by focusing on logistics.

"Are you staying in Seguro now?" Ana asked me, her accent making the word sound like a song.

"For now," I said, and felt the thinness of it.

June glanced at me but didn't say anything. She knew what for now meant. It meant until I found an excuse.

After breakfast, the heat thickened. I felt restless in a way that the safe room couldn't touch. I told June I was going to walk to the market and buy a new notebook. She said okay and asked if I wanted company. I said no because I needed the space to be dramatic and alone.

Outside the hostel walls, Cartagena was already sweating. The streets in Getsemani were slick from the storm, the puddles reflecting the pastel facades like a second city. The air smelled of diesel, salt, and damp earth. I walked past a courtyard with laundry hanging like flags, past a tourist couple taking selfies against a mural, past a woman in a doorway fanning herself with a plastic plate. Everywhere there were cracks: in the sidewalk, in the stucco, in the paint of old doors. The city wore its age like jewelry. It was hard not to love it for that.

At the market, I bought a new notebook with a cover patterned in bright birds. The vendor told me it was handmade, and I believed her because I wanted to. I bought a bag of guava from a boy who looked too young to be selling anything and too old to still be a child. I ate one as I walked back, the seeds hard against my teeth.

On the way, I passed a church with scaffolding up along one wall, men in hard hats moving like ants. A sign in Spanish explained that restoration work was underway to preserve the building for future generations. I read it twice. The words sounded like a promise and a warning. The sign had an official seal, a stamp of authority. I wondered what it took for a building to get that kind of care, how close to collapse it had to be before someone called it heritage instead of hazard.

I took a photo of the scaffolding and almost posted it with a caption about preservation and capitalism. I didn't. It felt too neat. It felt like the kind of post that would get likes and not change anything. I shoved the phone in my pocket and kept walking.

When I returned to the hostel, the tape was still across the heritage wing. The heat inside had grown heavy, the air unmoving. The courtyard fountain had stopped again, water pooled in the basin like a resignation. Carlos was on the phone, his voice low. He looked up as I passed and shook his head almost imperceptibly, a gesture that said don't.

I went to Seguro and put my new notebook on the bed. It looked too cheerful. I flipped it open and wrote my name on the first page in block letters, as if I were a child in school. Underneath, I wrote a sentence without thinking: I keep coming back to the room that wants me.

I stared at the sentence and felt my stomach drop, the way it does when you realize you have said something true by accident. I underlined it, then crossed it out, then underlined it again because my indecision was now visible and I might as well own it.

The afternoon passed slowly. June and Ana went to the beach. I stayed back, telling them I wanted to write. I did want to write. I also wanted to be near the closed door.

It was not long before I found myself in the hallway, staring at the tape. PELIGRO. The letters were thick and absolute. The tape had been placed as if it were enough to hold the building up, a bright ribbon between danger and us. I stood there for a minute, the hallway quiet, and felt the old wing breathing on the other side. It wasn't sound exactly. It was a pressure, a pull.

The door beyond the tape was closed, but the gap beneath it showed a strip of shadow. I crouched and peered through. I could see the edge of the landing and the darker stairwell beyond. It looked like a throat that had decided not to swallow. The air coming from underneath the door was cooler, damp. It smelled like earth and old wood, the smell of a room that had never quite dried.

I should have left then. I didn't.

I took a breath and ducked under the tape. It made a soft plastic hiss as I passed, the kind of sound you'd make if you were sneaking into a movie. The hallway beyond was quieter than the rest of the hostel, the air thick. The light was dimmer, the walls closer. I felt a small thrill, the same one I used to get as a child when I climbed fences I wasn't supposed to.

The stairs creaked when I put my foot down, a long, complainting groan. I waited. The sound died. The silence afterwards felt too deliberate. I continued up, my hand sliding along the banister. The wood was damp. It left a slick on my palm.

At the top landing, the light was different. The shutters in the heritage wing were half open, letting in thin blades of sun that cut across the hallway like something sharp. The air here was cooler, heavy with the smell of wet plaster. The bucket by the seam was missing now. The water had gone somewhere else.

My door was still stuck, but it opened with less force, as if the wood had given up some resistance. Inside, the room looked the same and not the same. The bed leaned more noticeably toward the outer wall. The crack in the ceiling had widened into a shallow V, the plaster along its edges broken and ragged. The mosquito net hung limp, draped like a veil. Dust floated in the sunlight, turning the air into a glittering fog.

The floor felt soft under my feet, not in a dramatic sinkhole way, but in a spongy, tired way. I pressed down with my heel and felt a small, sickening give. The bed frame had left deeper impressions in the floorboards, the metal feet now half embedded in the wood. It looked like the bed was trying to root itself before the room decided which way to fall.

I walked to the wall and pressed my palm against it. The plaster was damp. It chilled my skin. The crack was no longer just a line; it was a seam you could slide a fingernail into. I did, just to see, and felt the cool draft coming through. Somewhere beyond the wall, outside, a gull cried. I could hear it through the crack, a thin, distant sound that shouldn't have been in my room.

I took out my phone. I knew I shouldn't, but I did. I took a photo of the crack from the bed's angle, the sunlight cutting across it. The image on the screen made the room look dramatic, cinematic, the kind of danger you can swipe past. I held it there for a moment, the two realities layered: the actual ceiling above me and the ceiling as a rectangle in my hand.

I lowered the phone and looked around. The room smelled like wet adobe and old wood, like the inside of a history textbook left out in the rain. I could hear the building settling, tiny noises like tiny animals. I felt a strange tenderness for it, the way you might for an old dog who is still trying to climb the stairs.

I sat on the bed, feeling it tilt. The mattress had absorbed some of the damp, a coldness seeping through the sheet. I pulled out my new notebook and started to write.

The building is closed now, but it doesn't feel closed. It feels like someone shut a door on a person who is still speaking. The room is softer. The floor is tired. There is a draft through the crack that smells like outside and history. If this room were a person, I'd tell her to lie down. If I were a person with sense, I wouldn't be here.

I stopped. The words felt smug. I crossed out the last sentence and wrote instead: I'm here anyway.

The air was still. The silence was a kind of pressure. I felt like I was trespassing in a place that was about to confess something. I ran my fingers along the bedframe and felt the metal cold against my skin. The bed gave a small groan, as if it would prefer not to be touched.

There was a noise, soft and sudden, above me. I looked up. A thin line of plaster had loosened along the crack, a pale strip clinging by a thread. It dropped a moment later, a dusting of white onto the mattress. The sound was like a moth hitting a window. I stared at it, the small piece of ceiling on my sheet, and felt an odd surge of gratitude, as if the building had given me a sign just for me.

My phone buzzed. A text from my mother: "How was the storm? Are you still in that old wing?" Her timing felt like a joke. I didn't reply immediately. I stared at the message until the words blurred.

I thought of lying. I thought of telling her I'd moved and that the building was fine. I thought of telling her the truth and hearing the worry through the screen. I typed, "Moved to the newer room. The old wing is closed now. I'm safe." I stared at the sentence. It wasn't a lie, exactly. It just left out that I was currently sitting under the crack.

I hit send. The guilt was immediate and small, like a pebble in my shoe. I tucked the phone away and let the feeling settle into the room with everything else.

A knock at the door startled me. I shoved the notebook under my leg as if it were contraband.

"Emma?" June's voice.

"In here," I said, and felt my voice echo slightly, the room amplifying the trespass.

She pushed the door open and froze when she saw me sitting on the bed. Her eyes went to the ceiling and then back to me. "You went under the tape," she said.

"It wasn't taped at the top," I said, which was an answer to a different question.

She stepped in, the floor creaking under her weight. She looked at the bed frame sunk into the wood and grimaced. "This is bad," she said.

"It was worse last night," I said.

"That's not comforting," she said.

"I just wanted to write," I said. "It feels like if I don't record it, it didn't happen." 

"Or it happens because you're here to record it," she said, and the sentence hit me in a different place than she intended. She wasn't talking about superstition. She was talking about me, about the part of me that thinks the act of observing grants me a kind of immunity.

"You're not the main character in a building collapse," she said, softer now. "You're just a person in a building." 

"That's the problem," I said before I could stop myself. "I want to be the kind of person who is more than that." 

She sighed. "You are. Just not in the way you want to be right now." 

We stood there, the room holding our silence. Outside, a scooter backfired in the street, the sound a small explosion that made the plaster dust on my sheet tremble.

"Come down," she said.

I looked at the crack. The draft through it cooled my cheek. I thought about the notebook in my lap and the sentence I'd written. I thought about the yellow tape downstairs, how it was already softening into a suggestion in my mind.

"In a minute," I said.

June shook her head. "No. Now." She said it the way my mother would have, the way my teachers had. It made something in me flare. It made me want to stay out of spite, which was ridiculous and obvious and exactly what the building counted on.

"Fine," I said, and stood. The bed frame groaned again as I pushed off it. For a second, my foot sank a fraction into the floor. It was small, but it was enough. I felt the wood give under my weight like a tired knee.

June saw it too. We both went still. The room seemed to hold its breath.

"Did you feel that?" she asked.

"Yes," I said.

She didn't need to say anything else. We left. The hallway felt narrow, the air thick. The stairs creaked as we descended. We stepped back under the tape and into the brighter, louder part of the hostel, as if emerging from a confession.

June made me promise not to go back upstairs. I said I wouldn't. I meant it for the next hour.

The rest of the day dragged. I sat in the courtyard and tried to read, but the words blurred. The hostel filled with new arrivals, their backpacks slung low, their faces bright with the excitement of a place they had only just decided to love. I watched them check in, watched Carlos explain the rules. I watched him point out the heritage wing and describe it as "more rustic." He did not mention the tape. The tape was gone now, folded away behind the desk, replaced by a handwritten sign: CLOSED FOR REPAIRS.

One of the new guests, a blond guy in a tank top, asked if the heritage wing would open tomorrow. He said he had booked it for "the vibe." Carlos hesitated, then said, "We will see." The guy shrugged and went to put his bag down. The word vibe floated after him like a cheap perfume.

I felt irritated at him for wanting what I had wanted, as if his desire made mine less meaningful. It was petty. It was mine.

In the late afternoon, the heat broke a little, and the sky turned a soft gray. The air smelled like rain again, not a storm, but a warning. I leaned on the courtyard railing and watched the clouds build over the rooftops. The city held its breath. In the distance, a church bell rang, low and insistent. It was the kind of sound that makes you feel both small and spoken to.

Carlos came out with a plastic folder and a stack of papers. He looked tired, his shoulders slightly slumped. He saw me and paused. "Emma," he said, and held up a sheet.

"What is it?" I asked.

He handed it to me. It was a waiver. It was in Spanish and English, a dense paragraph of legal language that boiled down to the hostel not being responsible for whatever the building decided to do with me. I recognized it. I'd signed it when I checked in, a brief flick of my pen on a clipboard. Now it was being handed to me again, my name already printed at the bottom, a blank line for another signature.

"My uncle wants everyone in the heritage wing to sign again," he said. "New policy." 

"But the wing is closed," I said.

"He says it is closed," Carlos said, the hint of a smile that was more sadness than humor. "But he wants it open. He wants to show we do repairs. He wants to say it's safe." 

"Is it?" I asked.

Carlos didn't answer. He rubbed the back of his neck with his free hand. "The inspector hasn't come. But my uncle says we have to rent rooms. We need money." He looked at me. "You are not staying there now. You don't need to sign." 

The paper felt thin in my hands, a legal veil. I should have handed it back. I should have said no. Instead I traced the printed line with my finger and felt a small, ugly thrill. If I signed it, I could keep my key. I could keep my access. It would make the return official. It would make the story mine again.

"I'll sign," I said, and felt June's future disapproval as if it were already in the air.

Carlos looked relieved and guilty at the same time. He handed me a pen. I signed with a flourish that I regretted the moment I did it. My signature looked too confident on a document about collapse. I handed the paper back and watched him slide it into the folder. It looked like a stack of excuses.

"Thank you," he said. "Please be careful." 

"I will," I said, because I was still collecting promises.

That evening, the hostel grew quieter. The new guests went out to find dinner. June and Ana joined a salsa class. I told them I was too tired. The truth was that I wanted the quiet. I wanted the building without witnesses.

The heritage wing had been reopened, officially, though no one had moved back upstairs yet. The sign said OPEN, and the tape was gone. The hallway looked the same. I waited until the courtyard was empty enough and then went up.

The stairs were cooler now. The air felt dense, heavy with humidity. At the top landing, I paused and listened. The room was still, but the building was not silent. There was a faint ticking somewhere above, a small repetitive sound like a clock in a wall. It was irregular, which made it worse. It was the building trying to count time and failing.

I opened my door. The room smelled like wet wood and the faint rot of old walls. The crack was wider still, the edges ragged. The plaster around it had sloughed away, exposing the lath beneath. The beam above looked darker, swollen with water. It made me think of a bruise.

I set my bag down and climbed onto the bed, my feet sinking slightly into the mattress. The bed creaked under me. I stretched out and stared up at the crack. The mosquito net hung above like a thin, patient veil. The ceiling looked lower than I remembered. It was probably the same. It just felt closer now that I was choosing it.

I opened my new notebook and wrote by the light of my phone.

If I am honest, I am choosing this. Not because I think it is safe, but because I think it is significant. The room is asking to be remembered. I am the kind of person who says yes when something asks to be remembered. I don't know if that is bravery or vanity. I suspect it is vanity dressed up as bravery, which is still a kind of bravery, or at least a kind of vanity.

I stopped, read it back, and laughed quietly. It sounded like something I'd hate if someone else wrote it. It sounded like my worst self. I didn't cross it out.

There was a soft shudder somewhere above me, a minute vibration. Dust drifted down in the beam of my phone. I felt it land on my cheek, soft as flour. The building was reminding me, gently, that it had the last word.

I lay back and listened. The rain had started again outside, a light patter on the shutters. The wind nudged the wooden slats, making a small, persistent rattle. The room rocked with the rhythm of the weather, not enough to feel like movement, just enough to feel alive.

My phone buzzed with another message, this time from June: "Where are you?" I stared at it. I could lie. I could tell the truth. I typed, "In my room. Just writing. I'll come down soon." It was a lie shaped like a promise.

The rain deepened. A thunderclap rolled in the distance, long and low. The building answered with a creak that seemed to travel from one end of the beam to the other. The sound was like an old ship in harbor. I felt a thrill in my chest that was very close to fear and very close to excitement, and I couldn't separate them.

The room was dim, the phone's light narrowing the world to the page and the crack above. I turned the light off for a moment and let the darkness settle. The rain was louder without the distraction of light. The air smelled of wet plaster. I could hear the drip in the hallway, the slow leak that refused to be stopped. It sounded like a clock, again, as if the building was counting down in a language I could only half translate.

I turned the light back on and sat up. The crack had shed another thin ribbon of plaster, revealing a strip of rough lath. It looked like teeth. My chest tightened. I looked at the door, then back at the ceiling. The thought crossed my mind that if I left now, the building would still stand and I would have been wrong. The thought was the same one I'd had before, the one I hated. It had returned, stubborn as the rain.

I lay back down.

Above me, the beam made a small, wet sound, a creak with a catch in it, as if something inside had shifted. It was quiet, almost delicate. It should not have sounded delicate. The room held still after it, as if waiting.

I closed my eyes and listened to the rain, to the drip, to the breath of an old house that didn't care whether I stayed or went. My phone buzzed again, but I let it. I could answer later. I could go down later. I could do everything later.

In the dark, the ceiling seemed to lower by a fraction, or maybe I just knew that it could.

When I finally left the room, the hallway was empty. I turned off my phone light and let the dark swallow me for a moment, just to prove I could. The rain kept falling, soft and steady. The building kept talking. I listened, and listened, and pretended I could understand.

At the bottom of the stairs, the common room was empty. The courtyard lights were off. The only sound was the drip and the distant rumble of another storm moving in from the sea.

I had the key in my pocket. It felt warm, like it had been holding heat from my hand. I rubbed it between my fingers, the metal ridges pressing into my skin, and thought about the paper I'd signed, the waiver that said I was responsible for the weight above me. The words on the page felt abstract, legal, clean. The weight itself was not abstract. It was still there, above my head, patient and heavy.

I told myself I would sleep in Seguro tonight, like I promised. I told myself I would only visit the heritage wing in daylight. I told myself I could control the terms of my own danger.

The thunder rolled again, closer this time, and the building answered with a sound like a long, slow sigh.
