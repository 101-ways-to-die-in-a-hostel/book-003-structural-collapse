# Chapter 16: The Return

The crack in the ceiling looked wider at night, as if darkness pulled it open.

I lay on my back and waited for the room to decide whether it was going to kill me or simply humiliate me. The mosquito net hung above like a gauze shroud, its edges lifting with every breath of wind that slid through the warped shutters. Somewhere in the courtyard a loose shutter slapped against stone with the patience of someone knocking on a door that would not open. The sound measured time more accurately than any clock.

I should have been scared. I was scared. But fear had a boredom to it too, the way it repeats itself when you refuse to listen. My heart thumped, my ribs tight, but my mind was already narrating. The memoir was writing itself, even while I was trying to stop it.

I angled my phone up and took a photo. The crack caught a line of moonlight, a pale scar across the plaster. The beam above was a darker stripe, swollen from damp. I didn’t post it. I told myself I was saving it for a better caption. The truth was that even I knew how it would look now. Less authentic, more indictment.

The floor slanted toward the outer wall, a quiet surrender. When I shifted my weight, the bed frame groaned and sank, the legs pressing a little deeper into the softened boards. The movement was small, but it set my teeth on edge. I put my hand on the mattress, felt the spring give under my palm, felt the floor give underneath that. A layered softness, like the building was made of bread left too long in the rain.

“Uneven floors are part of the charm,” I said, because it felt more manageable if it was a quote.

The room answered with a creak.

I didn’t sleep. That’s what I told myself in the morning. The truth was a thin thread of sleep, a drift into a dream where the crack turned into a mouth and the beam became a tongue pressing down on my chest. I woke with the taste of dust, my mouth dry and my hair damp from the humid air. The storm had moved away, but the building was still in its mood.

I lay there and listened. The hostel in daylight was different — birds, faint voices, the clink of dishes from the kitchen. The old wing was quieter, as if it didn't want to admit the night had happened. I waited for my fear to return, and it didn’t. What came instead was a stubborn, stupid calm.

I sat up. The mosquito net tangled around my shoulder. I untwined myself, slow and careful, and set my feet on the floor. The boards were cool and slightly spongy, like stepping onto a wet sponge. I could feel the slant in my ankles, the subtle shift toward the wall. I pressed my heel into the wood and watched the floor dip, a tiny, humiliating give.

My notebook sat where I had left it, edges curled. I opened to the page I had written the night before and read it again. It was melodramatic. It was honest. I added a line:

The building is tired in the way old people are tired — bones soft, memory long, resentful of being asked to stand.

I closed the notebook. I should have packed and left for good. Instead, I made my bed. I smoothed the sheet, shook the net, made everything neat. It was the smallest rebellion against chaos, the kind of thing my mother would approve of. The bed creaked when I leaned on it. The floor dipped. The building accepted my effort with a tired sigh.

Outside, the courtyard was bright, the sun throwing hard light against the white walls. People sat at the plastic tables drinking coffee. It was impossible to imagine the building could be dangerous when the bougainvillea looked this happy.

I left my room and eased the door closed behind me. It stuck in the frame and I had to lift it slightly to get it to latch. The act felt like a secret. I could hear June’s voice in my head, telling me I was being an idiot. I could also hear my own voice, very calm, saying, I know. And I did.

In the hallway, the heritage wing felt asleep — cool, dim, a thin smell of damp wood. I paused by the bathroom door, the old one with the warped mirror, and caught my reflection in the dull glass. My hair was a mess, my skin blotchy from heat and fear. I looked like a person who could disappear without anyone noticing for a few hours. That thought was unhelpful and it stuck.

Downstairs, Carlos was behind the desk, a coffee in his hand that looked untouched. His eyes were heavy, the kind of tired that becomes part of your face. He looked up as I walked in, and there was a flicker of something in his expression — irritation, worry, a rehearsed patience.

“Buenos días,” I said, because I could at least pretend to be polite.

He glanced past me, toward the heritage stairwell. “You slept… upstairs?” he asked. His English had a question mark even without the question words.

“Just for a bit,” I said. The lie was small, which meant it was easier to carry.

He set his coffee down carefully. “The wing is closed. You know this.”

“I was only getting my things,” I said. It was the script, and I was a good student.

He pressed his fingers to the bridge of his nose, a gesture of someone who had run out of useful answers. “Emma, please,” he said, and my name sounded heavier in his mouth than in mine.

He reached under the desk and pulled out the waiver. My signature sat on the bottom, a neat looping cursive that looked too confident. The lines above were Spanish legalese, all warnings and non-liability. He tapped one paragraph. “This says you understand the risk,” he said. “You signed.”

“I didn’t think it meant—”

“It meant what it says,” he said, his voice low. He wasn’t angry. That was worse. “Old buildings can fall. People can die.” He looked at me in the same way my teachers used to look at the kids who thought they were exceptions.

I had no good answer. I tried to add nuance, because that was my reflex. “It’s complicated,” I said.

He gave a small, humorless laugh. “No,” he said. “It is simple. The roof is bad. The beam is bad. The rain is coming again.”

As if on cue, the sky growled. It wasn’t thunder yet, just the low roll of a distant storm, the promise of something building.

“Are you leaving?” he asked.

“I’m moving to Seguro,” I said, which was a second lie, softer than the first. I wanted him to believe it, and in the moment I almost did. There was something about saying it out loud that made it seem possible. Like a plan.

“Good,” he said, and there was relief in it. “There is space. I will put your name.”

“Thank you.”

He folded the waiver and slid it back under the desk. “Please,” he said again, but this time it sounded like a plea.

I nodded. It was the easiest thing I did all day.

In the courtyard, June was at a table with Ana and a new guy I hadn’t seen before, a Canadian with a sunburn and a wide-brimmed hat. They were discussing boat tours, their phones open to glossy pictures of islands and turquoise water. June lifted her hand in greeting and I felt a burst of guilt, the kind that makes you smile too brightly.

“Morning, rebel,” she said.

“Morning,” I said. I sat down, the chair still damp from rain.

“You okay?” she asked.

“I’m fine.”

She tilted her head. “You look like a person who slept in a haunted attic.”

“Close,” I said.

Ana laughed. “You are still in the old wing?” she asked, her eyebrow raised.

“No,” I said, too quickly. “I’m moving.”

The Canadian — Mark, he said his name was — looked between us. “Is the old wing really that bad?” he asked. “It looks sick. Like, in a good way.”

June snorted. “In a collapsing way,” she said.

Mark grinned. “Honestly, I love a bit of danger.”

“It’s not that kind of danger,” I said, before I could stop myself. My voice came out sharper than I meant. They looked at me. I smoothed it over. “It’s just… damp. Structural stuff. Boring.”

He nodded, already uninterested. The conversation moved on to food. The city, the tours, the usual churn of backpacker planning. I smiled at the right moments and kept hearing Carlos say, People can die.

June suggested we go out for lunch, and I said yes because it was easier than saying no. We walked into the street where the air smelled of fried corn and sea salt and horse manure from the carriages. The sun was sharp, the kind that makes the shadows feel like a relief. Vendors called out in Spanish, the words rolling like music. A man selling mango slices laughed when Ana practiced her accent.

The walled city was a postcard close-up. Yellow facades, blue balconies, tourists with hats too new to be loved. I watched a cart creak over the cobblestones and felt the old stones under my sandals, uneven, soft with time. Everywhere was a story. Everywhere was decay wrapped in paint.

We ate arepas from a stand by a church. The corn was sweet and oily, the cheese thick and salty. I licked grease off my thumb and felt like a child in a place that wanted me to be an adult. A bell rang out from the church, loud and clean, and a flock of pigeons exploded into the air.

On a wall near the church, a laminated poster flapped in the wind. It was a weather alert in Spanish, the kind with official logos and a map of the coast shaded in ominous colors. I didn’t stop to read it. I didn’t need to. The words tormenta and alerta were large enough to understand without translating.

An older woman selling flowers caught my eye and shook her head. “Viene otra lluvia,” she said. Another rain is coming. Her face was all lines and sunlight. She touched the crucifix at her throat and looked up at the sky, not at me. I smiled at her and kept walking, as if weather were a rumor you could ignore.

June was talking about taking a boat to the Rosario Islands. Ana said she didn’t trust the water. Mark said he’d do anything to avoid another day “sweating in history.” I laughed when they laughed. I was only half there. The other half was back in the room, looking up at the crack and pretending it was art.

On the way back, the sky had a different color, a darker blue where the clouds were stacking. The humidity pressed harder. A distant rumble rolled over the rooftops. I felt it in my chest, a soft vibration. The city was still bright, still busy, but there was a waiting in the air.

Back at the hostel, the sign on the heritage stairwell had been updated. A sheet of paper taped to the wall read CERRADO in thick black marker. The word looked official enough to stop anyone who wanted to be stopped. I passed it like it was decor.

In the common room, the TV had found a weather channel. The presenter stood in front of a map with a serious face, the kind of seriousness that feels performative until it isn’t. Carlos had turned the volume low but not off. He glanced at the screen, then at me, then back to the screen. I sat on the couch for a moment and pretended to watch. The weather graphic spun over the sea, a spiral of white and red. The words category and alert flashed beneath it.

My phone buzzed. A message from my mother. “Are you still in the old building? Please say no.” Her timing was immaculate. I typed back: “No. Moved to the safe room. Storms look dramatic but fine.” The lie felt like the arepa grease on my fingers — sticky, unavoidable, already absorbed.

June sat beside me and bumped my knee with hers. “Boat tomorrow?” she asked.

“Maybe,” I said. The word didn’t commit me to anything. It just opened a possibility that I knew I wouldn’t take.

We sat in the common room until the heat softened and the first drops of rain ticked against the shutters. The air inside the hostel was damp and heavy, the kind of air that makes you slow and sleepy. People drifted toward naps. The building groaned in the heat, old wood expanding and contracting, the sounds like a body trying to get comfortable.

---

At noon, the heat was sticky enough to feel like a weight. I walked through the common room and toward the heritage stairwell. My key was in my pocket. My body did not feel like it belonged to me so much as to the habit of the last days.

Marta was on the landing with a mop and a bucket. She was small and sturdy, her hair gray and pulled back. She saw me and her eyes widened. “No,” she said, in Spanish, then crossed herself. “No suba.” Don’t go up.

“I just need to get my bag,” I said, because I was still pretending.

She shook her head hard enough to make her earrings swing. “No es bueno,” she said. Not good. “Está malo. Malo.” She pointed toward the ceiling with the mop handle, as if the building itself needed to be reminded.

I smiled, the polite tourist smile. “Solo un momento,” I said. Just a moment.

She clicked her tongue. “Ustedes,” she muttered. You people. It was not a compliment.

I wanted to tell her I wasn’t like the others. That I read the plaques on walls, that I knew the year the convent was built, that I cared about the weight of history. The absurdity of that thought hit me even as I had it. She didn’t care about my nuance. She cared about the roof not falling on her while she cleaned.

“No voy a quedarme,” I lied, and my accent made the words softer, less convincing. I kept walking before she could answer. The mop water smelled faintly of bleach and mold, two efforts fighting each other in the damp.

I took the stairs two at a time, as if speed could pass for righteousness. The hallway above was darker than before, the shutters pulled tight. The air smelled of damp plaster and old wood. A single fly buzzed lazily near the ceiling, a thin, irritated sound.

My door was stiff but opened. I stepped into the room and closed it behind me. The familiar humidity wrapped around me like a damp blanket. The crack in the ceiling was longer now. It might have always been this long. It might not have. The problem with paying attention is you have to admit what you see.

My bag was on the chair. I picked it up, then sat down on the bed, because the bed was still mine, and I couldn’t quite let that be untrue. I opened the notebook again. The line I’d written earlier stared back.

The building is tired. So am I.

I could leave. I could move to Seguro and tell June I’d finally joined the living. Instead, I opened Instagram and wrote a caption I would not post:

“Another storm rolling in. The kind that makes the walls remember they are made of earth. Sleeping in history, trying not to be crushed by it.”

I stared at it. The words looked ridiculous, the kind of sentence that would get a few likes and a few eye rolls. It was the kind of sentence I was always writing, to turn fear into content. I deleted it and left the photo in my drafts.

There was a knock on the door. A light, hesitant tap.

“Emma?” June’s voice, muffled by the wood.

My stomach flipped. “One second,” I called, my voice too high.

The doorknob rattled. “Are you in there?” she asked.

I could tell the truth. I could open the door and leave with her. I put my hand on the knob and felt how stiff it was, the wood swollen, the frame tight. I imagined it jamming, imagined June pulling, imagined being trapped. I felt a flare of panic and then, because panic is embarrassing, I chose stubbornness instead.

“Yeah,” I said. “Just getting my things.”

“You said that an hour ago,” she said. The humor was gone.

“I’m coming,” I said, and I meant in a minute, just not now.

There was a sigh on the other side. “Emma, stop doing this,” she said. “Please.” The word hung there, thin and frayed.

“I’m fine,” I said, and the lie felt like chalk in my mouth.

She didn’t answer. Her footsteps moved away.

I sat on the bed with my bag in my lap. The floor dipped. A faint creak came from the beam above, like an old man clearing his throat. I held still until it passed. The building did not collapse. The building did not forgive.

I went to the window and pushed at the shutter. It resisted, the wood swollen, but it opened a fraction. The street below was bright, the sea a strip of blue. Clouds were gathering over the horizon, a line of darker gray. The heat buzzed with that expectant pressure before rain.

Back at the bed, I put my bag down and told myself I would leave after a shower, after lunch, after the next chapter in my book. The logic was ridiculous, but it felt like control. The room was mine. If I left now, it would mean I had been wrong. If I stayed, I could still pretend I was right.

By afternoon the rain began, soft at first, a gentle patter against the shutters. Then it grew, a thicker sound, the rhythm of something approaching with purpose. The air cooled, and the building started to talk. A slow, groaning complaint ran through the walls. The floorboards beneath my feet made a delicate popping sound, like knuckles cracking.

I made tea in the common room and carried it upstairs in a chipped mug. It sloshed on the stairs. My hand was slightly shaky. I told myself it was caffeine.

The rain became a curtain. I sat on the bed and read a few pages of García Márquez, the words blurring as I listened to the sound of water. It felt fitting, sitting in a room that could collapse, reading about people who lived with ghosts and war. I underlined a sentence and thought about posting it with a caption. I didn’t.

A deep creak came from above. It was the sound of a large piece of wood settling, the kind of noise that makes your organs pause. I looked up, tea halfway to my mouth. The beam was unchanged, or it wasn’t. The crack in the plaster looked darker, like something had seeped into it.

“It’s an old building,” I said. “Old buildings make noise.” I was using Carlos’s warnings as if they were my own, reshaping them into comfort.

Another sound, closer. A soft thud, like something small falling. A dusting of plaster drifted down and landed on the bedspread. I watched it settle, tiny flakes of white. The air smelled of damp and old wood and, underneath that, a faint metallic tang.

I set the tea down and stood. The floor dipped, the bed frame groaned. I felt a tug in my ribs, the urge to leave and the stronger urge to stay just long enough to prove I could leave whenever I wanted. I went to the door and turned the knob. It was stiff but it moved. The door opened with a reluctant scrape. The hallway beyond was dim, the light bulb flickering.

I stepped into the hall. The air was cooler, the smell of wet plaster stronger. I could hear the rain hammering the roof, a relentless, physical sound. The hallway was empty. The doors were closed. The heritage wing felt like a ship below deck.

I walked to the top of the stairs and looked down into the brighter part of the hostel. I could hear voices from the courtyard, laughter, the clatter of cups. It sounded like life continuing without me. I could go down. I could be part of it. I could tell June she was right.

Behind me, a crack sounded in the room. It was sharp, quick, like a twig snapping. I froze. The sound was followed by the low groan of wood adjusting under pressure. The building was moving in tiny, tired increments, like a person shifting to find a position that doesn’t hurt.

I turned back. The door to my room was still open, a rectangle of darkness. The crack in the ceiling was visible from the hallway, a pale line. I could see the bed through the mosquito net, the sheets dusted with plaster. The room looked so small from here. The danger seemed almost polite.

“I’ll just grab my book,” I said, to no one.

I stepped back into the room. The door scraped and stuck in the frame. I pushed it open and left it that way, as if that made me responsible. I picked up my book, then my notebook. I stood there with my things and did not move. The rain hit the shutters, the building groaned, the beam above me made a low, tired sound.

A memory flickered: my mother at the kitchen table, saying, You don’t have to prove anything to anyone. I had rolled my eyes and left. Now the memory felt like a prayer.

I sat down anyway. The bed dipped. The floor gave. The building sighed. Outside, thunder rumbled, closer now, the sky darker. The storm had not left; it had only circled back for another pass.

I knew I should leave. I knew it the way you know a fact you keep forgetting. But the room was quiet, and I was tired, and there was a perverse comfort in sitting in the danger and pretending it was just atmosphere.

I opened the notebook and wrote:

The storm came back. So did I.

The sentence looked small on the page. I underlined it twice. I could hear the rain, the wind, the building’s low complaints. The air was thick with humidity and old dust. The light from my phone was a weak, lonely circle in the room.

There was another small crack. Somewhere in the ceiling, something shifted. The beam above me made a sound like a slow sigh. I held my breath, waiting to see if it would break. It didn’t. Not yet.

I lay back on the bed and stared at the ceiling. The crack was a line of dark against white, a seam in the plaster that led my eyes toward the beam. The mosquito net hung still. My chest rose and fell. The storm pressed against the shutters with the patience of a hand testing a door.

Downstairs, someone laughed. The sound was distant, almost kind. It made me feel very alone in the room, in the building, in the story I was writing without knowing how to end.

I turned off my phone light to save the battery. The room sank into darkness. In the dark, the crack above me felt wider, more alive. I listened for the next sound, the next warning, the next reason to leave.

The building creaked, deep and tired, and the rain replied.
