# Chapter 12: The Softening

The dark was so complete it felt like a decision the building had made.

For a second I couldn't remember where I was. The candlelight below had vanished; the hallway's familiar edges dissolved. Only my phone's flashlight kept the stairwell from becoming a throat. The crack above my bed, the one I'd been measuring with metaphors all day, seemed to laugh in the dark. It was a tiny sound, like a tick in old wood, but it felt personal, as if the house had developed a sense of humor and I was the punchline.

I took another step down, my hand sliding along the smooth rail. The banister was cool and damp under my palm, the sort of damp that makes you think of cellars and old bread. Rain hammered the shutters somewhere, a rapid drumming that turned the air into a vibration. The building groaned in slow waves. It was breathing with effort.

Below, I heard voices, a low murmur made larger by the empty spaces between words. I reached the last step and the common room came into view as a row of weak flames. Carlos had lit candles and placed them along the bar and tables, little islands of light in a room full of shadows. People clustered around them, cups in hand, the hostel suddenly intimate in the way crises force.

June looked up when I entered. Her face was a slice of gold in the candlelight, her eyebrows lifted in the same unspoken question she'd been asking me all day.

"Did you get your things?" she asked.

I held up my backpack. "Essentials," I said. The word sounded lighter than it felt.

Carlos moved between tables with a flashlight, his jaw tight. He was giving instructions in Spanish and English, the syllables clipped from repetition.

"Everyone in the modern rooms can stay," he said, sweeping the light across a few faces. "Heritage wing guests need to sleep downstairs tonight. It's safer. We'll put mattresses in the common room." His light paused on me, a quiet insistence. "Emma, please." 

I nodded. It was easier than saying yes.

The mattresses were thin and smelled of mildew, pulled from a locked closet that probably hadn't been opened in years. June and Ana claimed a corner by the wall; I chose a spot near the doorway, as if proximity to an exit might translate to control. The floor tiles were cool through my linen pants, damp around the edges where rain had found its way under the doors.

A gust shook the building. The shutters rattled like bones. Someone swore in French. The bar candles flickered and went out in a wave, plunging us into darkness. A few people gasped. Then the emergency light over the reception desk blinked on, a weak green glow that made everyone look sick.

In the dim, the hostel sounded different. Every creak was louder. Every drip, a countdown. The broken fountain in the courtyard had overflowed, the water running in a steady stream that echoed through the arches. The smell of wet adobe was sharp, like a wall bleeding into the air.

I lay on my back and stared at the ceiling, which here was newer and flatter and much less interesting. The irony of feeling unsafe under the safe roof was not lost on me. It was too smooth to read. I couldn't find any lines to trace, any history to feel. The lack of cracks was, weirdly, a discomfort.

People tried to sleep. The guitars were gone, the jokes quieted. Everyone had their phones out, screens glowing briefly as they checked weather apps and texted people in other time zones. I opened my mother's message again. "Please, Emma. Please move." I imagined her in our kitchen in Surrey, rain tapping a window that did not leak, her hands wrapped around a mug. The thought made me feel small and very far away.

I typed, "I'm downstairs in the common room. It's fine." I hesitated. Then I added, "I promise." I hit send. The word promise looked bold and fragile on the screen.

The storm intensified. The sound rose from a steady drum to a roar. The building shifted, a long, low creak that moved through the floor like a slow animal. The emergency light flickered. Ana whispered a prayer in Spanish, too quick to catch. June rolled onto her side and tucked her knees toward her chest.

My eyes kept drifting to the stairwell, even though I didn't want to go up. The thought of my room above, my mosquito net hanging empty like a ghost, made my stomach twist. The room had been my stage, my proof. Leaving it felt like a concession I hadn't rehearsed.

Around midnight, Carlos took another lap, checking on people. His flashlight swept across my face. "You okay?" he asked.

"I'm fine," I said, because that's what you say when you want to be done with a question.

He hesitated. "If the roof in the heritage wing moves again, we stay down here. No one goes up. Do you understand?"

"I understand," I said. I did. I also knew I would find a way to make an exception if I could justify it.

At some point the storm reached its peak and then, like a tantrum, began to exhaust itself. The wind softened. The rain fell into a slower rhythm. The building's groans became sighs. People fell asleep in their piles of damp blankets and backpacks, their breathing syncing with the fountain drip.

I was still awake when the emergency light blinked out for good. The darkness was total again, but this time the storm outside was quieter, the world less full of teeth. I listened for the sound of breaking wood and heard only the drip, the distant roll of thunder, the small noises people make in sleep.

A thought arrived, quick and unwelcome: my journal was still in my room. It was in my bag earlier, but I'd taken it out to write, then left it on the desk. I could picture it exactly, the cover soft from humidity, the pages curled like petals. It felt wrong to leave it up there, exposed to rain, to collapse, to whatever might decide the fate of paper in the night.

I told myself to ignore the thought. I told myself that a journal was not worth a ceiling. I told myself that was sensible.

Then I sat up anyway.

I moved quietly, stepping around sleeping bodies, past the extinguished candles. The emergency light was gone, but my phone's beam was enough. The stairwell was dark and damp. I could smell the upstairs air before I reached it, the heavier scent of wet wood and plaster. The building was almost still now, the storm's violence reduced to a distant rumble.

Halfway up the stairs, I paused. The railing felt colder than before. The floor under my feet felt softer, as if the wood had absorbed too much water and no longer wanted to be firm.

I could have turned back. I could have decided that paper was paper. Instead I climbed the rest of the way, the light from my phone making the walls look jaundiced. The hallway was slick underfoot, puddled from the seam that had been dripping all day. The bucket had overflowed long ago. Water ran in a thin stream toward the stairs, reflecting my light in slivers.

My door was stuck, worse now. I put my shoulder to it and lifted. The frame swelled, resisting. When it finally gave, the scrape was loud enough that I held my breath, listening for footsteps below. None came.

Inside, the room smelled of wet earth. The plaster crack looked like a dark vein in the flashlight beam, wider now, the edges soft. I stepped carefully toward the desk. The floor slanted more than it had that morning. It wasn't a dramatic slope, just a slight shift that made my stomach notice. I looked at the bed. The metal frame seemed lower, as if the legs had sunk into the floorboards. The mattress pressed against the wall, its corners dented. It made the bed look tired, like it had given up on holding itself up.

I found my journal and slipped it into my bag. The page I had left open was damp at the edge, the ink slightly blurred. My handwriting looked like it was running. I didn't like the way the dampness made the words feel less permanent.

I should have left then. Instead, I sat on the edge of the bed and listened. The room was still, but not quiet. The building had a low, constant noise, a hiss of rain, a whisper of wood settling. I could hear the storms of the city beyond the shutters, the wind funneling down the street. The room felt like the inside of a mouth, damp and waiting.

My phone buzzed. A notification. Someone had liked my draft photo, the one I'd saved but not posted. Instagram suggested I should share it because it was doing well with my "close friends." I laughed silently at the absurdity of an algorithm encouraging me to post about a crack while I sat under it in the dark. The laugh tasted bitter.

I took a photo anyway, a quick shot of the crack in the flashlight beam. It looked dramatic, a jagged line across centuries. The edge of the frame caught the mosquito net, limp and translucent. It was a beautiful, stupid picture.

I didn't post it. I sent it to June instead. "Look," I typed. "It's worse."

She replied almost immediately: "Come down. Please."

I stared at the word please for a long time. It carried a weight that I hadn't been able to hear in my mother's texts. It sounded like it hurt to type.

"I'm coming," I wrote.

But I didn't move right away.

I stood, and the bed frame gave a small groan. The floor beneath my feet felt spongier, as if the wood had soaked up the storm and was now too tired to hold me. I pressed my foot down and felt a slight give. It wasn't enough to be frightening. It was enough to make me think of knees bending under weight.

The plaster around the crack was soft now, damp to the touch. I pressed a finger against it and it sank, the surface yielding like wet chalk. When I pulled away, my fingertip was white. I rubbed it on my pants and felt a strange surge of affection, as if the building were a child that had gotten sick and I was testing its forehead.

I told myself this was romantic. I told myself it was empathy. I told myself it was anything other than stubbornness.

Outside, the rain began again, a lighter, more persistent drizzle. It made the room seem sealed off, as if the sound of water were a curtain. The world below felt distant, hazy. I thought about sleeping here just for a few hours, then going down at first light, and the thought felt like a compromise I could live with.

Then the beam above me creaked. It was a long, slow sound, like something yawning. Dust drifted down in the flashlight beam. I watched it float, each particle lit and lazy, as if time had slowed for the sake of dust. My chest tightened.

I stood, took my bag, and went to the door. It stuck again, the swollen wood reluctant. I had to set my bag down to lift and pull. The door finally opened with a shudder. The hallway beyond was empty, the air thick. I stepped out and pulled the door closed behind me.

I had taken two steps toward the stairs when I heard another sound behind me, sharp and distinct. It wasn't the long groan of settling wood. It was a crack, like a bone snapping in a body I wasn't in. I froze. I could feel the sound in my teeth.

The door in front of me trembled, just a fraction. The crack above it seemed to deepen, a line of darkness widening. A flake of plaster fell and landed on my bag, a white stain on the canvas.

I backed away, slowly. The hallway was tilted too, or maybe it was just my sense of balance. I couldn't tell. The stairwell yawned below like a mouth. The light from my phone looked small and inadequate.

The rationalizations were quiet now, as if they'd gone to sleep downstairs. The room behind me made another low sound, a wet sigh. I could picture the floorboards, soaked, giving. I could imagine the bed legs sinking a fraction deeper. I could imagine the wall breathing out dust.

I took a breath and moved down the stairs. The railing was slick. My hand slid on the wood. I put my palm flat and forced myself to keep going.

Downstairs, June was half awake, her face creased with sleep. She sat up when she saw me.

"You went up," she said. It wasn't a question.

"I forgot my journal," I said.

She looked at my bag, then at my face. In the dim light of my phone, her eyes seemed very dark. "Did you see it?" she asked.

"It's worse," I said. "The floor feels... soft." The word was inadequate. It was the closest I had.

She shook her head, a small movement. "You can't sleep up there," she said.

"I won't," I said, which was true, because I was now on the floor in the common room. I wanted to be proud of myself. I felt tired instead.

The rest of the night passed in fragments. I drifted in and out of sleep, dreaming of soft walls and dripping ceilings. The rain slowed to a steady whisper. The building settled around us. At some point, someone turned on the emergency light again. At some point, dawn arrived, turning the courtyard into a gray pool of air.

When I woke, the storm was gone. The sky outside the courtyard was a pale, exhausted blue. The city sounded tentative. You could hear individual birds, a rooster in the distance, the clink of someone sweeping. The hostel was quiet, damp, and depleted.

Carlos was already up, moving between sleeping bodies like a nurse in a ward. He had circles under his eyes and a tightness around his mouth. He stopped by my mattress and crouched down.

"Are you okay?" he asked.

"Fine," I said.

He nodded, as if he didn't believe me but also didn't have time to interrogate. "We will check the heritage wing," he said. "Please wait downstairs until we say it is safe."

His voice was firm. It was a boundary, not a suggestion. I should have listened.

Instead, after he walked away, I sat up and listened to the quiet. The quiet felt like a dare. The building wasn't groaning now. The daylight softened everything. I thought about my room above, my bed, my things. I thought about the crack and the way it had looked in the flashlight beam. I thought about how dramatic it would look in morning light. I thought about the sunlight through the shutters, the columns of gold. I thought about how I could write about it, how the storm had tested the building and it had held.

Held was a generous word. I still used it.

June was asleep, her hair stuck to her forehead. Ana's arm brace lay on the floor beside her, abandoned in sleep. The room was full of still bodies. It felt like a good moment to slip away, a private return. I told myself I would just look, then come back down. I told myself that knowing was better than imagining. I told myself that was responsible.

I climbed the stairs again. The hallway smelled worse in daylight, the mildew more pronounced. The water had pooled in the corners, darkening the wood. The bucket at the seam was half full now, the drip slowed to a steady tear.

The door to my room was still stuck, but less so now that the air had cooled. It opened with a squeal. The room was brighter than I expected. Sunlight had found its way through the shutters, slicing the dust into visible beams. The crack in the ceiling was wider, the edges rough. A thin line of plaster had fallen along the length of my bed, leaving a white trail on the sheet like a powdery snow.

I stepped inside and looked around as if seeing it for the first time. The bed did look lower. The legs had sunk into the floorboards unevenly, the mattress leaning toward the outer wall. I put my hand on the metal frame and felt it give slightly, the floor beneath it soft from rain. The word soft returned, insisting itself into my vocabulary.

The floor itself was damp. My sandals left faint prints on the boards. I could smell the adobe through the plaster, an earthy sweetness that made me think of pottery and graveyards. The wall near the crack was darker, wet, as if the building had sweated through the storm.

I leaned close to the crack. There was air in it. A thin, cool draft kissed my cheek. I could see a sliver of light through the plaster, a needle of daylight where there should have been solid wall. I should have been terrified. Instead I felt a strange thrill, like I had discovered a secret passage in a book.

It was ridiculous. It was me.

I took another photo, this one with the morning light making the dust glow. The crack looked almost beautiful, like a river on a map. I knew how I would caption it. I could already see the comments, the shocked emojis, the "please be careful" from people who loved me in the way people love through screens.

I didn't post it. I opened my journal instead and wrote, my hand moving faster than my thought:

The building softened overnight. It held, but it softened. There is a thin breath coming through the ceiling, a cool whisper. I'm trying not to hear it, trying to make it poetry, but it is physics. It is the weight of four hundred years and a storm, pressing down like a palm. I slept on the floor with thirty strangers and still dreamed of this room. I think I want to be the kind of person who can read danger and not romanticize it. I don't know if I am.

The last sentence looked like a confession. I closed the journal and felt exposed.

There was a soft knock at the door. June's voice. "Emma?"

"In here," I said.

She appeared in the doorway, squinting up at the ceiling. "You weren't supposed to come up," she said.

"I just wanted to see," I said.

She stepped inside and ran her fingers along the crack. The plaster crumbled at her touch. She pulled her hand back, dust on her skin. "This is not safe," she said, her voice low.

"It's still standing," I said. It sounded like a defense of an old friend.

"Standing isn't the same as safe," she said.

I didn't answer. I looked at the bed and then at her. She was waiting, her hands on her hips, her mouth a thin line. I could feel a stubbornness rising in me like a tide. It was stupid, and I could see it. That didn't stop it.

"If I leave now, I'll feel like I ran away," I said.

"You didn't run. You slept on the floor," she said. "You did the brave thing already. Now do the sensible thing too." 

She sounded like a mother. That made me bristle. I could feel it. I hated it about myself.

"It just feels like I picked this room for a reason," I said. "Like it says something about me if I leave." 

"It says you're not dead," she said.

I laughed despite myself, because she was right and because the bluntness sliced through the haze. It didn't make me move, though. My feet felt rooted to the damp boards.

June looked around the room, taking in the softening floor, the widened crack, the angle of the bed. She sighed. "Okay," she said. "Then at least let me help you move your things to Seguro. You can come up to write or take photos, but sleep in a room that doesn't feel like a sponge." 

"That's a compromise," I said.

"Yes," she said. "Do you want it?"

I didn't. But I did. It was the kind of compromise that let me keep the story while also not dying for it. It made me feel practical, even if the practicality was borrowed.

"Okay," I said.

We packed my things together. My backpack was already half-full. I added my clothes, my toiletries, the paper marigold. I hesitated over a small stack of books, then took only one. As I lifted the book from the desk, a small piece of plaster fell and hit the cover with a soft tap. It felt like punctuation.

The hallway was brighter now, the courtyard below filled with morning light and the smell of coffee. Carlos was at the reception desk with a clipboard. The irony of the clipboard after last night's inspector wasn't lost on me. He looked up when he saw us.

"You are moving?" he asked.

"Yes," I said. The word felt like swallowing a stone.

Relief flickered across his face. He didn't try to hide it. "Good. Good. I will put you in Seguro with the others. It is not as..." He searched for the English. "Not as historic."

"I can still visit history," I said.

He gave a small, tired smile. "History will still be there."

We carried my bag across the courtyard. The fountain had stopped, finally out of water. The puddles on the tile reflected the sky. The air smelled like wet stone and coffee grounds. Someone in the kitchen was slicing fruit, the sweet scent of mango cutting through the mildew. Life was resuming in that careful way it does after storms, tentative and hungry.

Seguro was at the far end of the 1920s wing, its door wide open. Inside were eight bunks, clean sheets, a ceiling that looked like any cheap hostel ceiling in the world. It smelled of detergent and damp socks. The floor was level. The window closed.

I put my bag on the bottom bunk near the door. The mattress was firm, the kind that didn't know how to collapse. It was safe in a boring way. I sat on it and felt the lack of give. My body didn't know how to relax without the slant.

June set her bag on the bunk above me. "See?" she said. "It's fine."

"It's fine," I said, and we both knew I meant the room and also something else.

I spent the morning helping dry out the common room. We mopped the floor, wrung out towels, moved mattresses back to the closet. Everyone was slightly delirious from the lack of sleep. There was laughter in the exhaustion. Ana told a story about her aunt's house flooding and everyone sleeping in the kitchen; she made it funny, a tale of fish in the living room, and we laughed even though it was a story about water where water didn't belong.

Carlos thanked everyone for moving downstairs and said the heritage wing would be closed until further notice. He said it in Spanish and then in English, his voice firm. A few people groaned because they had booked the heritage rooms for the vibe. He offered refunds and free breakfast instead. He looked at me when he said it, a look that said, Thank you for finally choosing sense.

The day warmed. The sun came back with the arrogance of tropical weather, as if the storm had never existed. The city outside the walls resumed. Carts rolled over cobblestones. Music drifted in from a bar. The smell of arepas lifted into the courtyard. In the heat, the storm felt like a story someone else had told.

I went up once more in the afternoon, against Carlos's instructions, because I couldn't help myself. The heritage wing was quiet, the hallway empty. The air was thicker there, more humid. The crack in my room had widened again. It was no longer a line; it was a gap. The plaster around it had crumbled in places, revealing the lath beneath. The beam itself looked darker, wet. I held my breath and listened. The building was still, but I could hear a faint, intermittent tick overhead, a small noise like a clock in a room you are trying to ignore.

I told myself I was just checking, just satisfying curiosity. I told myself the danger had passed with the storm. I told myself the building had survived four hundred years and could survive another week. I told myself that because the sun was out, the weight had lifted.

The floor made a quiet creak when I shifted my weight. The bed frame groaned. The mosquito net hung limp, like a flag surrendered. Dust floated in the sunlight. It was beautiful. It was wrong.

I went back downstairs and didn't tell anyone I'd been up. It felt like a betrayal of their concern, but it also felt like something I needed to keep for myself, a private ritual with the building.

That evening, I sat in the courtyard with June and Ana and a few others, sipping cheap beer. The sky was pink and orange, the kind of sunset you post with a caption about gratitude. I felt grateful for the warmth, for the fact that we were all still here.

Ana asked me if I missed the heritage wing.

"I miss the story," I said.

"You still have the story," she said. "You just don't have the ceiling."

"The ceiling was part of it," I said.

June smiled. "You can write about it without sleeping under it. That's the trick." 

"Is it?" I asked.

"It's the trick if you want to keep writing," she said.

I thought about that, about the future me who would read these pages and see this choice, the moment I moved. Would she respect it? Would she roll her eyes? Would she think it was boring? Would she be alive to have the opinion?

The thought made me shiver despite the heat. I wrapped my cardigan around my shoulders.

As the sky darkened, the wind picked up again, gentler this time. The shutters in the heritage wing rattled in response, a faint, distant sound. I listened to it like a person listening for their own name.

Back in Seguro, I lay on my bunk and stared at the safe ceiling. It was smooth and blank. There were no cracks to trace, no stories to read. The room was full of the soft breath of eight sleeping people. I could have slept easily.

Instead I lay awake, listening to the building. The old wing creaked, a slow, constant sound that seeped through the walls. Each creak felt like a whisper, a message I couldn't quite hear. I told myself it was just wood, just age. I told myself the danger was past. I told myself that choosing safety didn't mean choosing boredom.

Then a sound cut through the night, sharp and brief, like a branch breaking somewhere far off. It came from the heritage wing. I sat up. The other girls didn't stir. The sound was quiet, maybe nothing. It could have been a door, a shutter, the wind.

I lay back down. The mattress was firm. The ceiling was intact. The building was still old, still full of bones. The storm had softened it. The weight was still there.

In the dark, I heard a drip begin again, slow and steady, like a clock restarting.
