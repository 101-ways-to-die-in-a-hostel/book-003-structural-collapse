# Chapter 17: The Vigil

I woke to the sound of water inside the room, not outside it.

For a moment I thought it was the rain pushing through the shutters, a trick of the storm, but the sound was different. This was a steady drip, patient and close, as if the ceiling itself had decided to cry. I lay still and listened, my breath shallow so I could hear it better. Drip. Drip. The rhythm of something giving up.

The mosquito net hung above me like a wet veil. I could feel the dampness in the air, thick enough to taste, and the sheet clung to the back of my knees. I reached for my phone and the screen lit the room in a pale circle, just enough to show the crack in the plaster. It looked darker now, swollen around the edges, the way a bruise does when it has accepted its color.

Drip. Drip.

I sat up and the bed dipped, a soft, unhappy motion. The floor beneath it yielded with a quiet complaint. The slant was more obvious in the dark, a tilt that made my stomach feel like it was sliding. I put my hand on the bed frame and felt the metal vibrate with each gust of wind, as if the building were playing a slow, tired instrument.

“Authentic,” I whispered, because the word had followed me like a bad habit and I was afraid of what would happen if I stopped saying it.

The drip came from somewhere near the beam, a thin line of water running down the wood and onto the plaster. The beam was glossy with moisture, its surface catching the phone light in little wet highlights. It looked less like architecture and more like flesh. I imagined it sweating under the pressure, a back held up too long.

I swung my legs over the side of the bed and stood. The floorboards felt spongy under my feet. The air smelled of damp adobe and old wood, a sour sweetness. When I moved, a dusting of plaster loosened and fell from the crack, drifting down like powdered sugar.

I told myself I would check the ceiling, maybe put a bucket under the drip, do something useful like a responsible adult. Instead, I walked to the shutters and pressed my forehead against the wood. The storm had grown thicker again, a low roar and an occasional thud of wind. Lightning flashed, turning the slats into pale bars. Through the thin gaps I could see the street below, slick and empty, the color of wet asphalt and spilt ink.

My phone buzzed. A message from June, sent hours earlier: “You asleep?” I stared at it, the timestamp a small accusation, and typed back: “Yeah. In bed.” The words were true, in the narrowest way. I didn’t send anything else.

The drip continued. I found the chipped plastic cup from the tea I’d brought up earlier and held it under the leak. The water was cold against my palm. It collected slowly, a tiny clear pool. I thought about tasting it for the story and then decided I liked my kidneys too much.

When I put the cup down on the floor, the boards flexed, the water trembling with the movement. I couldn’t tell if that was me or the building. I couldn’t tell the difference anymore.

I sat back on the bed, phone still in my hand, and opened the notes app. I had the habit of writing in tiny fragments, a way of keeping myself honest while still turning everything into something I could post later. The cursor blinked. I typed:

The roof is leaking. It sounds like a heartbeat. I am in a room older than my country, and it wants me to pay attention.

I deleted the last clause. It sounded dramatic. It sounded like me. I left the first sentence.

There was a soft thud somewhere in the hall, a sound like a door settling. I froze. The heritage wing was supposed to be empty. The wing was supposed to be closed. The wing was supposed to be anything but a place where I could hear other sounds. I held my breath and listened. The storm answered with a gust that rattled the shutters. No footsteps. No voices. Just the low, moaning creak of the building stretching under the wind.

I stood and walked to the door. The handle was warm under my palm, a ridiculous detail. I turned it gently and the latch moved, but the door did not open. The frame had swollen again, or shifted, or both. I tried lifting and pulling, the same trick as before, and the wood scraped against the frame with a dry rasp. The gap opened a finger’s width, then stuck.

It was almost funny, in a dark way, that I could lock myself into the room by simply staying. It was the kind of trap a lazy ghost would set.

“Okay,” I said, as if I were negotiating with a stubborn animal. “Later.”

I let the door settle back into its frame. The click sounded final, like a punctuation mark. I leaned my forehead against the wood and felt the building’s slow, constant vibration. Somewhere above me, the beam groaned. I could feel it more than hear it, a low pressure in my bones.

The drip hit the cup. Drip. Drip.

I went back to bed. I lay down and pulled the sheet up to my chest. The mosquito net brushed my shoulder. I watched the crack in the ceiling for a long time, the way you watch a person you don’t quite trust. The crack did not move, but it felt like it could, like a mouth deciding whether to speak.

I thought about the waiver. I had signed my name so neatly, the loops of my letters like rope. It was still somewhere downstairs, in a folder, my consent in black ink. I had been proud of myself for not reading it, for being easy, for proving I could do the authentic thing without fuss. It was a small rebellion against my mother, against Cambridge, against the future. A tiny legal document was not supposed to mean anything real.

Drip. Drip.

I closed my eyes and waited for sleep. The storm did not let me. The rain hit the shutters in uneven bursts. The wind pushed at the building like a test. Each gust made the beam answer with a different pitch, a low groan, a higher creak, the occasional sharp complaint. The building sounded like a body in pain trying to get comfortable.

At some point I drifted into a shallow, uneasy sleep. I dreamed of the courtyard fountain running clear, the water lifting up in a column, not falling. I dreamed of my father’s voice saying “You can’t read your way out of this,” which wasn’t something he had ever said, but it was something I could imagine him wanting to.

I woke again, not to the drip this time but to the sound of something scraping. It was faint, rhythmic. I sat up, heart thudding. The sound stopped. I listened, trying to locate it. It came again, a soft scrape along wood, as if something were sliding along the wall. A gecko, I told myself. The hostel was full of them, their little chirps like punctuation in the night. But this was heavier, slower.

My stomach turned. I wanted to laugh at myself for being dramatic. I wanted to grab my bag and leave. The door was still stuck. I put my hand on the knob and pulled. The wood gave a millimeter, then held. The scrape started again, now closer, a long, wet sound. I pressed my ear to the door. Nothing. Just my own breath loud in my head.

“Stop it,” I said, and I didn’t know if I meant the building or myself.

The scraping stopped. The storm returned to its steady roar. The drip in the cup was louder now, the water level higher. I lifted the cup and emptied it into my water bottle, because the idea of spilling water on this floor felt like tempting fate. The water was clear. I drank a sip despite myself. It tasted of dust.

I was thirsty anyway. The air in the room was drying me out, pulling moisture from my mouth and skin. I sat back down and wiped my damp palms on the sheet. The fabric was already damp. The whole room felt like an organism that sweated in the dark.

There was a thin crack of thunder, sharp and close. The room shivered. The bed frame rattled. I watched the crack in the ceiling widen by a hair, the plaster flexing. I blinked. I told myself it was the angle. The phone light made everything look different. It made my fear look larger than it was.

Another message buzzed. This time it was my mother: “Just checking in before bed. Love you.” I stared at the words and felt the guilt gather like a tightness in my throat. I typed, “Love you too. In a safe room.” The lie was the same shape as the others.

I sent it and set the phone down. The battery was at seventeen percent. The headlamp I’d bought for a hike in Peru was in my bag, a cheap plastic thing. I put it within reach, like a superstition.

I tried again to sleep, and again the room refused. After an hour of staring at the ceiling, I decided I needed to move, to do something that wasn’t just waiting. The drip in the cup was still steady. I imagined it soaking the ceiling, the beam swelling. I imagined termites, fat and pale, chewing in the dark.

I needed to use the bathroom anyway, and the idea of walking the heritage hallway felt better than sitting still. It felt like a choice, which was close enough to control to be comforting.

The door resisted when I pushed, then gave with a wet scrape. I slipped into the hallway and closed it behind me. The air out here was cooler, the smell more pronounced: damp plaster, old wood, a hint of mildew. The hallway was dark except for the thin light leaking from my room. The other doors were closed, their surfaces bloated by humidity. The walls glistened in places where water had seeped through, turning the whitewash a darker, mottled color.

At the end of the hall, the shared bathroom door stood open. A faint light glowed from a bare bulb inside, flickering as if it couldn’t decide whether to stay. I walked toward it, my footsteps loud on the warped floorboards. With each step the floor dipped slightly, the slope toward the outer wall more obvious here than in my room. I put my hand against the wall for balance. The plaster was damp and cold.

In the bathroom, the mirror was fogged. The sink was stained a permanent beige. Water dripped from the ceiling here too, landing in the corner of the shower with a hollow plink. The floor tiles were slick under my bare feet. The air smelled of mold and soap and a faint metallic tang.

I looked at my reflection anyway. I looked tired, paler than the morning before, my hair stuck to my forehead. The flashlight from my phone made shadows under my eyes. I looked like someone waiting in a place that didn’t want her.

When I finished, I washed my hands and watched the water swirl down the drain. The pipes gurgled, a sound that made me think of a throat clearing. I leaned against the wall and listened. The storm outside had shifted to a lower, steadier noise. The building creaked around me, the sound a slow, internal conversation I could not translate.

On my way back to the room, I stopped by the window at the end of the hall. The shutters here were more rotten, the wood soft. I pushed one slat aside and looked out. The courtyard was empty, puddles reflecting the dim glow of the lights. The fountain was overflowing again, water spilling over its cracked edge. In the reception area, a light was on. I could see movement behind the desk, a silhouette crossing the space. Carlos, maybe, or one of the late-night guests. The storm had turned the courtyard into a small pool, the water shimmering with the occasional flash of lightning.

I felt very far away from that light, like I was on the wrong side of a story. The heritage wing was its own world, its own time. I pressed my forehead to the wood and closed my eyes.

A sound behind me made me turn. It was nothing, just the drip in the bathroom, the creak of the building. The hallway felt more enclosed now, the darkness thicker. The floor beneath me made a soft popping sound as if it were adjusting to my weight.

I hurried back to my room. The door stuck, then opened with the same reluctant scrape. The air inside felt warmer, more humid. The drip in the cup was faster now, the water hitting the plastic with a wet impatience. I set my phone on the bed and sat down, the mattress sinking under me.

I thought about going back downstairs, about knocking on June’s door, about telling her I was scared and letting that be enough. I imagined the look on her face, the mixture of relief and irritation. I imagined sleeping in Seguro, waking to a dry ceiling and a flat floor. The image was so comforting it almost made me angry.

From somewhere below, a voice rose, muffled by floors and old plaster. Carlos, I thought, on the phone again. The sound of Spanish in the night was soft and urgent, the cadence of someone making a case that kept getting denied. I caught only the rhythm, not the words. The effect was still clear: even the adults didn’t know what to do with this building except keep asking it to behave.

On the wall above the bed was a faded postcard print of the city from the colonial era, all clean lines and bright flags, ships in the harbor. It had been hung there for atmosphere, a decoration to prove history had passed through and left something aesthetic. The paper was warped now, the edges lifting in the damp. I traced a finger along the frame and felt the thin film of moisture. The picture of the fortress looked sturdier than this room.

I pulled my knees up and hugged them, not because I was cold but because I needed to be contained. The mosquito net brushed my hair, a soft itch. I looked at the phone screen again and almost opened Instagram, a muscle memory. I could already see the post: a gloomy black-and-white of the crack, a quote about impermanence, a caption about colonialism bearing down. It would get a handful of likes and one comment from my aunt. It would mean I had turned this into something consumable, which was easier than admitting I was scared in a locked room with a leaking ceiling. I put the phone face down again and let it be quiet.

The room shifted with a subtle sigh. The floor gave a little under the bed, a slow settle. I felt it through the mattress, a deep settling that made my stomach lurch. I pressed my palm to the floorboards and felt the dampness seep into my skin. The wood was soft enough to indent.

This room had become a challenge, a test of something I couldn’t name. It was foolish and I knew it. But I also knew that leaving now would mean admitting that my choices were stupid. I could handle being wrong in theory. In practice it felt like a collapse of a different kind.

The storm answered with another gust, a shove that rattled the shutters hard enough to make them thump against the frame. The bed shook. The beam above groaned in a new, deeper register. Dust fell, a light mist that settled on my hair and on the sheet. I brushed it away and the particles stuck to my damp fingers.

I stood and moved the cup, emptying it again. The water was clearer than it had been before, but still tasted of wood. I drank another sip, as if I were testing the room, as if I could learn something from it. The water tasted like history: mineral and old, a hint of rot.

A thud came from somewhere above, a single heavy sound. I froze. The thud was not the light creak of wood. It was a drop, a shift. I waited for another. The room was still. The storm roared. The drip continued.

My phone buzzed again. This time it was an Instagram notification: “Your draft is waiting.” I’d left a caption in there from earlier, the one about sleeping in history. I opened it and read it in the dim light. The words felt too sharp now, too close to the truth. I imagined posting it, watching the likes come in, the comments: brave, jealous, iconic. The thought made me feel sick.

I deleted the draft.

The gesture felt small but meaningful, like closing a door even when it wouldn’t latch. I put the phone face down and climbed onto the bed, sitting cross-legged. I opened my notebook to the page I’d written earlier and read the lines about the room breathing. I added a new line beneath it:

If the building wants to tell me something, it should speak clearly.

It was a dare. It was also a request.

I sat there with the pencil in my hand, waiting. The storm obliged with a low, rumbling thunder that shook the window. The beam above me creaked. The crack in the plaster widened another fraction. I could see the dark line expand, a slow, almost elegant separation. A tiny chunk of plaster dropped, landing on the sheet near my knee. I picked it up and turned it between my fingers. It was soft and damp, crumbling at the edges.

My heart was doing that quick, sharp thing it did when I was nervous, the same rhythm as before exams. I wanted to go. I wanted to stay. I wanted someone else to make the choice.

I lay down with the notebook on my chest and the pencil still in my hand. The mosquito net brushed my nose. I could feel the weight of the room, the pressure of the air, the low hum of the building’s old joints. Outside, the storm showed no sign of leaving. It had settled into a steady presence, a long-handled pressure against the walls.

I thought about the building’s history. The hospital, the apartments, the hostel. The blood and the births and the sweat, the centuries of people passing through. I thought about the walls holding all of it, and the beam above me holding the walls. The beam felt suddenly too human, too much like a spine.

The drip in the cup was louder now, the drops falling faster, the pool rising. The sound was like a clock, counting down to a time I didn’t know.

I closed my eyes. I told myself I would sleep. I told myself the building would hold. I told myself that if it didn’t, I would have time. I told myself a lot of things.

Another crack split the air. It was louder than the others, sharp and sudden. I opened my eyes to see the crack in the ceiling a little wider, the plaster around it fractured like dry earth. The beam was still intact, still solid, still there. But the sound had come from somewhere close, and it had the unmistakable note of wood giving way.

I sat up, heart pounding. The bed dipped. The floor seemed softer. I put my hand on the wall and felt a slight tremor, as if the building were shivering. The storm outside surged, the wind lifting, pressing. The room felt like a lung filling to its limit.

A faint hiss of water came from the corner, and when I looked I saw a thin line of moisture running down the wall, a new leak, a wet vein. It traced a path toward the floor, darkening the plaster as it went. I watched it as if it were a living thing. It reached the baseboard and pooled, the water gathering in the corner where the floor slanted toward the outer wall.

The pool grew. The floor drank it slowly, a thirsty sound. The bed frame creaked. The mosquito net swayed, though there was no breeze. The drip in the cup sped up, a quickened rhythm.

I stood, my knees unsteady. I could leave, now, I told myself. I could open the door, force it, go down the stairs, knock on June’s door and tell her she was right. I turned to the door and put my hand on the handle.

Behind me, the beam gave a long, deep groan. It was not the ordinary creak. It was a sound like a held breath releasing. I froze with my hand on the knob. The building shuddered, a subtle sway, enough to make the mosquito net sway and the cup of water ripple.

The door handle felt hot under my palm. I pulled. The door moved a fraction, then stuck. I lifted, pulled again, the wood scraping like teeth. The gap widened, then the frame shifted with a small, decisive click, and the door stuck again. My pulse banged in my ears.

“Come on,” I whispered, but the door did not.

I shoved with my shoulder. The door gave another fraction. The gap was just wide enough for a hand. I pushed harder, and the door creaked open with a slow, reluctant movement. The hallway beyond was dark, the light bulb flickering. The air out there looked cooler, thinner.

I stepped into the hallway and the floor beneath me sagged. The movement was small but immediate, a shift that made my stomach lurch. The wall to my right gave a soft crack, a hairline fissure branching out like a vein. I stared at it. It hadn’t been there before. Or maybe it had, and I had refused to see it.

The storm outside roared, a heavy, continuous sound. The hallway felt like the inside of a drum. I could feel the building’s pulse in the banister under my hand.

I should have run down the stairs. Instead I stood there, staring at the new crack in the wall, at the way the plaster around it darkened with moisture. The building was speaking clearly now, in the only language it had: shifting, cracking, leaking. I was the only one still pretending not to understand.

I took a step toward the stairs, then another. The wood groaned. The air smelled of damp, of old stone, of something sour and metallic. The stairwell was darker than I remembered, the light from below weak. I heard a muffled laugh from the courtyard, a voice that sounded far away.

I stopped. The door to my room was still open behind me, a dark rectangle. The bed was visible through the mosquito net, the sheet dusted with plaster. The cup was on the floor, water trembling in it. The room looked like a place already abandoned.

I thought about leaving the notebook there. I thought about leaving everything there. I thought about the story I would tell if I got out.

Then the beam groaned again, louder, and the floor dipped under my feet, just for a second, just enough to remind me that I was standing on something that could decide to stop.

I turned back toward the room, not because I wanted to stay, but because I needed to grab my bag, my phone, my foolishness. I stepped inside, the door scraping behind me. I bent to pick up the bag.

The building shuddered. The cup of water tipped and spilled onto the floor. The drip in the ceiling became a thin, steady stream.

I stood there in the dark room, holding my bag, the storm roaring outside, the beam above me giving a low, tired sound. I could feel the floor soft under my feet, the wall damp under my shoulder, the air thick with plaster dust and rain.

Somewhere, deep in the building, something shifted. The sound was low and heavy, like a chair being dragged across a stone floor. The kind of sound you feel in your teeth.

I held my breath and waited for whatever came next.
