# Chapter 11: The Widening

The crack was wider in the morning, as if it had slept badly and stretched.

I woke to light leaking through the shutters in bright bars, the kind that makes you squint and feel guilty. The storm had moved on, leaving the room to sweat in its wake. The air was wet enough to drink. My mosquito net hung around me like a curtain in a cheap theater, and the ceiling above had rearranged itself overnight while I wasn't looking.

The new line of plaster I had photographed the night before had fattened. It wasn't a dramatic gash, not yet. It was still thin, still the kind of thing you might ignore if you were late for breakfast or if you had a story to protect. But it was no longer a hairline. It had a second, faint thread branching off like a capillary. It looked, disturbingly, like something that wanted to keep going.

I lay there and tried to make myself into the type of person who didn't panic at ceiling geometry. The rationalizations arrived like late friends.

Buildings breathe, I told myself. Plaster shrinks when it dries. The storm had been dramatic, and everything that survived drama tends to look a little worse for it. Old structures flex. This was that flexing. The crack wasn't structural; it was cosmetic. Cosmetic is such a comforting word. It belongs to makeup and dental whitening, not to the bones of a four-hundred-year-old building.

The word cosmetic stuck in my head and made me laugh a little. I wondered if anyone had ever told a building it looked tired and needed concealer.

I sat up carefully, as if the crack might be listening. The bed frame sighed under my weight. I checked the floor with my water bottle. It still rolled toward the outer wall with reliable obedience. I caught it before it hit the door and set it against the skirting board. It looked like a test I could pass if I chose the right answer.

The wall felt damp when I put my palm against it, a cool slickness of adobe that made my skin goose. I followed the crack with my finger, tracing it like a map. My nail dislodged a small flake. It landed on my sheet like a piece of dandruff. I brushed it off and tried not to think about the ceiling shedding in its sleep.

There were voices in the hallway, soft and practical, and I realized with a sudden embarrassment that I had been lying in bed watching plaster while other people had already started their day. I pulled on my linen pants and a t-shirt, braided my hair, and put my glasses on even though I didn't need them. I looked more like myself with the glasses. If I looked like myself, then I could pretend my world hadn't shifted slightly overnight.

At the door, I paused. The frame stuck, swollen from the humidity. I lifted and pulled, as instructed. The wood scraped against itself with a sound like a throat clearing. When it finally opened, I stepped out and immediately looked back at the ceiling, as if it might have changed again in the time it took me to turn the handle.

The hallway was brighter than my room. Sunlight filtered in from the courtyard, catching dust in the air. The bucket by the seam was full and spilling onto the floor, the water creeping in a thin line toward the stairwell. The drip had turned into a steady thread. I stepped over it and told myself I was being melodramatic. I was already collecting metaphors, and I didn't want to make puddles part of them.

Marta was at the end of the hall, standing with a mop and a look that said she wished the floor could tell her what it planned to do. She didn't come to the heritage wing often. She was here now because water makes messes and messes are her job. She glanced at me, her eyes moving quickly from my face to the ceiling and back.

"You sleep there?" she asked in Spanish.

"Yes," I said. It came out with the soft th at the end, the kind of pronunciation that made me sound either formal or ridiculous.

She made a noise in her throat, somewhere between a hum and a disapproval. She took out a handkerchief and wiped her forehead, then crossed herself quickly, the gesture like a reflex. She did not say anything else. She just went back to mopping as if my choice was a stain she couldn't scrub.

I told myself she was superstitious. I told myself she had probably seen too many horror movies. I told myself that her crossing herself didn't mean the ceiling was about to fall. It meant she was Catholic. It meant it was morning. It meant nothing.

In the courtyard, the air was already warming. The broken fountain gurgled weakly, fed by rainwater that had nowhere else to go. Someone had tied a plastic bag around the faucet to try to stop the drip; it flapped in the breeze like a surrender flag. People sat in hammocks, shoulders bare, skin glistening. The hostel always looked a little like it was posing for itself.

June sat with a cup of coffee and a notebook. Ana was there too, her hair braided, her arm resting on the table like it was heavy. She wore a thin brace, a souvenir from the falling tile a few nights earlier. When she saw me, she lifted her eyebrows in a question.

"Did you move?" she asked.

"Not yet," I said.

"You should," she said, then took a sip of coffee and made it sound like a suggestion instead of a verdict.

June slid her notebook to the side. "How is it up there?"

"Charming," I said. "Authentic. Slightly more authentic than it was last night. The crack is very on-brand."

"That isn't funny," June said, but she smiled anyway.

I sat down, and the chair wobbled. The courtyard chairs are always wobbly. It felt like an omen anyway. I ordered coffee at the bar and listened to the Spanish radio crackle through weather updates. The presenter described more storms forming, more rain, the season dragging itself toward November. I looked up at the sky. It was blue now, edged with white. The sun was bright enough to forgive the city for the night before.

Carlos appeared from the reception desk with a stack of papers and a phone in his hand. He looked tired, his hair damp even though it hadn't rained in hours. He paused when he saw me.

"Buenos dias, Emma," he said.

"Morning," I said.

He tapped the papers against his palm, as if aligning them could also align his thoughts. "I have a room in Seguro," he said. "One of the girls checked out early. If you want it, it's yours. Same price." He said it gently, but it was an offer and a warning tucked together.

I glanced over his shoulder at the hallway that led to the heritage wing. The shadow there seemed deeper than it should, even in daylight. I could still hear the steady drip from upstairs, a small persistent sound that felt like it was threading itself into everything.

"Is it really necessary?" I asked.

He hesitated. "The storm was strong," he said. "The building is old. It moves. Sometimes it moves too much." He watched me for my reaction, his face open and guarded at the same time.

"I saw a new crack," I said. It felt good to say it out loud. It made it real.

He nodded once. "Yes," he said. "We saw it too. Marta told me."

"Maybe I can just..." I started, then trailed off because I didn't know what I was trying to say. Maybe I can just keep an eye on it? Maybe I can just be careful? Maybe I can just continue pretending that my thoughts could steady a beam?

Carlos waited. He did not push. The courtyard fell into a brief lull, the music between songs, the fountain gurgling. Somewhere a scooter buzzed past outside the walls.

"I want to stay in the heritage wing," I said, and heard the stubbornness in my own voice. It wasn't loud, but it was sharp.

He exhaled slowly. "It is your choice," he said. "But if the door sticks, if you hear big cracks, you come down. You do not wait." He said it in English, because he knew I'd hear the warning better in a language that could carry my guilt.

"I won't wait," I said. I said it like a promise and made myself believe it.

June watched him walk away. "He is trying," she said.

"I know," I said.

"So why are you trying so hard not to listen?"

I looked down at my hands. There was a small smear of plaster on the side of my index finger, chalky and pale. It looked like a dusting of powder, as if the ceiling had touched me lightly to remind me it existed.

"Because if I leave now, it looks like I stayed for the wrong reasons," I said. "Like I needed a story and then ran as soon as it got inconvenient."

"That is literally every story," June said. "You can't make the ending be brave just because you wanted it to be."

"You sound like a fortune cookie," I said, and she laughed. The laughter helped. It made the air around the warning feel less tight.

A man walked into the courtyard with a backpack and the wary look of someone who had been dropped somewhere without instructions. He was local, or at least local enough not to carry a passport in his hand. He glanced down the hall toward the heritage wing and then looked away quickly, as if it had spoken to him. Carlos said something to him in Spanish and gestured toward the modern rooms. The man nodded immediately. He did not ask about the old wing, did not look tempted by authenticity. He looked like someone who had seen enough of this city to know where the pretty danger lived.

I watched him disappear into Seguro and felt a small, bitter twist in my chest. It was not jealousy. It was the recognition that he knew something I didn't. I tried to tell myself it was because he was local and superstitious. I tried to tell myself he had a family and needed to be practical. I tried to tell myself that I was choosing differently because I had a different kind of courage.

The word courage tasted strange on my tongue. It was not the word I would have chosen if I were telling someone else this story.

I finished my coffee and felt it settle in my stomach like a small stone. The day warmed. People planned beach trips, made lists, checked weather apps. The hostel buzzed with motion and normalcy, which made the cracks feel less real. That was the problem with danger when it takes its time. It looks like a rumor in the middle of a sunny morning.

I went upstairs anyway.

---

In my room, the air had gone stale. I opened the shutters as far as they would go. The wood scraped and shed a curl of paint. Outside, the street shimmered with heat. A boy rode by on a bicycle, a basket of mangos balanced on the handlebars. A woman swept her doorway. A dog lay in a patch of sun, indifferent to both history and weather.

I took another photo of the crack, this time with my camera instead of my phone. I moved the mosquito net aside and stood on the bed to get a better angle. The ceiling was closer than it should have been. The beams looked darker, the grain more pronounced, like a face aging under harsh light. I captured it anyway. It would make a good post. The thought made me feel disgusted with myself and then amused. At least I was honest about my own worst impulse.

I sat at the small desk by the wall and opened my journal. The paper curled at the edges from humidity. I wrote:

The crack is wider. I say that like it is a metaphor. It is literal. The building is speaking in a language I keep pretending is poetic.

I underlined literal. It was the kind of word that felt sharp in my hand.

My phone buzzed with a message from my mother. I didn't open it right away. I could already predict its shape: weather alert, concern, love. I wanted to be the person who could reply with reassurance. I wanted to keep being the person who seemed fearless in her own narrative. I opened it anyway.

"Storm warning upgraded. Please tell me you're not in the old wing. Love you."

My throat tightened. I thought about lying. I thought about telling her I had moved and then moving tomorrow so it would be true retroactively, a lie that became a plan. I thought about telling her the truth and listening to her say I told you so without using those words. I thought about saying nothing and letting her worry in silence, which felt cruel in a way I didn't want to own.

I typed, "It's fine. The building is old but stable. I can move if I need to. Love you." I stared at the word stable and felt my stomach hollow out. I pressed send anyway. I told myself that a building that had stood four hundred years could handle one more storm. I told myself that was evidence, not romance.

On the desk, my paper marigold from the market lay flattened under my notebook. I picked it up and turned it in my fingers. It was bright and fragile, cheap and careful. I put it back down and looked at the crack again.

The line was not just wider; it was longer. The branch I had noticed earlier had extended toward the wall, a thin vein. The plaster around it had started to hair. It wasn't yet a web, but it was heading that way. I considered the word propagation, the way cracks travel through materials when the material can't hold the stress. The idea of stress felt personal. I had chosen to put myself here. The building didn't get to choose its age.

A knock on the door startled me. I almost hit my knee on the desk as I stood.

"Emma?" June's voice.

"Come in," I said.

She pushed the door, and it stuck before giving in. The scrape sounded louder from inside the room, like the building was clearing its throat to announce visitors. She stepped in and looked up immediately. "Oh," she said.

"Yep," I said.

She crossed the room and stood beside me. We both stared at the ceiling as if it were a painting and we were trying to find a hidden image. "It really is bigger," she said.

"It's cosmetic," I said, because the word had been keeping me company all morning.

"Cosmetic cracks don't branch," she said.

"Maybe it's just a cracked cosmetic," I said. It was a terrible joke. I tried to make it lighter. She didn't smile.

June walked to the window and looked out. "I just spoke to Ana," she said. "She said Marta won't go upstairs anymore."

"Marta is afraid of everything," I said, too quickly.

"She's afraid of this building," June said, then turned back to me. "Do you want to move with me? I can ask Carlos if we can share a room for a few nights."

I imagined the modern wing, the safer beds, the windows that closed properly. I imagined June's mild snore and the way she kept her shoes lined up. I imagined waking without the ceiling staring at me.

"It's not that I don't want to," I said. "It's that..." I let it trail off because the rest of the sentence was either ridiculous or honest, and both options felt embarrassing.

June waited.

"I feel like if I move, I'm admitting something about myself I don't want to admit," I said.

"That you can be wrong?" she asked.

"That I'm not adventurous," I said.

"This isn't adventure," she said. "It's a ceiling."

I laughed, sharp and small. "It doesn't feel like a ceiling," I said. "It feels like the point of the trip."

"Trips have too many points," she said. "You can miss one."

She was right. She was also making me feel small, and I didn't like that. It was petty. It was human. I stared at the crack again and tried to convince myself it was also small.

"Let me think about it tonight," I said.

June nodded. "Okay. But promise me you'll leave if you hear something." She gestured toward the beam. "Something bigger than that."

"I promise," I said. I didn't know if I meant it, but I said it.

She left, the door scraping behind her. The room felt empty after she closed it, like the crack had more space to stretch. The air was dense with humidity, and my skin felt damp in a way that didn't cool me. I turned on the fan. It clicked twice and began to spin slowly, pushing warm air into a slow circle. I sat on the bed and let it move the mosquito net like a thin flag.

I opened my phone and pulled up Instagram. My last post was the photo of the cracked beams with the caption about authenticity. It had more likes than most of my travel posts. I tried not to feel smug about that. I tried to see it as a warning instead, like my friends were quietly saying, We see the crack too.

I hovered over the new photo. The crack looked dramatic in the light, dark against the pale plaster. It was, objectively, a great shot. I typed a caption before I could stop myself: "Old buildings don't hide their stress. Neither do I." It was pretentious and honest and would probably get comments from my university friends about how deep I was. I didn't post it. I saved it to drafts and told myself that was restraint.

There was a low, subtle creak overhead. I froze. The sound was like a tree in wind, long and slow. It ended with a soft click. I waited for it to happen again. It didn't. I told myself it was the building cooling from the storm, the beams shifting as the day warmed. I told myself that wood sounds like that all the time. I told myself that if it were serious, it would be loud.

The fan continued to hum, and I began to feel ridiculous for being afraid of a noise in a room built out of noise. I lay back on the bed with my book. "One Hundred Years of Solitude" had started to smell slightly damp, the pages curling. It felt like a useful joke. The Buendias had their own crumbling house; we were having a literary moment together.

I read for an hour, but my eyes kept drifting to the ceiling. The crack's shadow shifted as the light moved. It looked like it was moving, which was impossible and therefore terrifying. I shut the book and decided to go downstairs, to find people and noise and a version of the day that didn't include plaster falling on my head.

In the stairwell, the wall was damp enough to darken my sleeve when I brushed against it. I wiped it with my hand and smelled the adobe on my skin. It smelled like earth. It smelled like old rain. It smelled like the kind of thing that doesn't change quickly.

The common room was fuller now. Someone had brought in a guitar, and the sound of someone learning chords skittered around the space. The storm had given everyone an excuse to gather and then the heat gave them a reason to stay. It felt communal in a way hostels sometimes do when the weather is bad. It felt like safety because there were bodies and chatter and light.

Carlos stood by the door, talking to a man in a uniform. The man had a clipboard and a cap with an official-looking emblem. He was probably from the city. He was certainly not from any of our conversations. Carlos glanced over at me, then back to the man. The man looked up toward the ceiling as if the walls could answer questions.

My stomach tightened. I did not want an inspector to be present in my story. Inspectors make everything real. I sipped water and pretended not to stare.

The man left after a short conversation. He did not come upstairs. He did not close the heritage wing. He did not do anything that would make my choice easier. He just walked out into the sun and left Carlos looking more tired than before.

"Everything okay?" June asked, appearing beside me with a paper cup of something that smelled like pineapple.

"Apparently," I said.

"Do you know who that was?"

"Maybe city inspection," I said. "Maybe a cousin. Maybe a man who sells clipboards."

June tilted her head. "He didn't look like he liked the building."

"Who does?" I asked, and then regretted the sarcasm. It made me sound like I wanted to defend the building. I wasn't sure I did. I wasn't sure I could stop myself anyway.

We sat on the edge of the courtyard in the shade. The broken fountain gurgled in a steady rhythm, water dripping from the lip into the pool below. The drip was loud enough to hear over the guitar, and it sounded like a clock. I watched each drop fall and thought about the word accumulation. That was how dread worked: not in one big piece, but in many small additions.

Ana joined us with her mango, now cut into cubes in a plastic cup. "You are still in Historia?" she asked me.

"Yes," I said.

She shook her head. "My aunt in Medellin has a house like that. Old. When it rains, she sleeps in the living room because the roof in the bedroom moves. She says you can hear it breathing. She says you can hear it die."

"That's grim," I said.

"That's Colombian," she said, and smiled. "We know buildings. We know which ones have bones that are tired."

"This one has bones," June said.

"All buildings have bones," Ana said. "Some are just... thin."

I wanted to argue. I wanted to say that this building had survived wars, humidity, centuries of neglect. I wanted to say that if it was still standing, it must want to be. I wanted to say that if I left now, I would be abandoning a story I had already told.

Instead I ate a piece of mango from Ana's cup. The sweetness hit my tongue and softened the sharpness of everything else. I chewed slowly, as if I could make the moment last longer. The storm was coming back, all the news alerts said so. It was a matter of hours. The hostel felt like a breath held in.

"I'm not saying it will fall," Ana said. "I'm just saying, when the walls talk, you listen."

I nodded, because I had no other way to respond. I listened to the fountain and the guitar and the distant sound of the street. I listened to the building, which kept making small noises of its own, the kind you stop hearing if you don't want to hear them.

At some point, the sky changed. The light flattened, the heat pressed down, and the breeze brought the smell of rain. It was the same smell as yesterday, metal and wet earth. The courtyard quieted as people looked up, as if the sky had called their names.

Carlos went through the common room again, handing out candles. He paused at me. "We may need to move everyone tonight," he said.

"Tonight?" I asked.

He nodded. "The storm is supposed to be stronger. If we get the alert, I will tell you."

"Okay," I said.

"Emma," he said, lowering his voice. "Please be ready."

"I will," I said. I tried to sound sure.

He squeezed my shoulder briefly and moved on. The gesture was gentle, almost fatherly, and it made me feel both safe and guilty. I watched him, his posture tense, and thought about the owner in Bogota, about the inspector with the clipboard, about all the people who knew the building was tired and yet kept it standing for those of us who wanted to sleep in history.

I went upstairs to pack a small bag, just in case. It felt like compromise. It felt like hedging, which is something I do well. I stuffed my journal, my passport, my phone charger, and the paper marigold into my daypack. I left my clothes in the locker. I told myself I would only be gone for a night if it came to that. I told myself I was being sensible, not scared.

As I folded my cardigan, a small piece of plaster fell from the ceiling and landed on my bed with a soft puff. It was about the size of a fingernail, white and chalky. I stared at it, then at the crack it had come from. The crack looked a shade darker, a shade deeper. It looked, for the first time, like it might be a gap.

"Okay," I said out loud, to no one. It was a strange word to choose. It felt like a door closing.

I picked up the flake and turned it in my fingers. It was warm from the air. I put it on the desk like a souvenir, then regretted it and swept it into the trash.

The rain began just after sunset. It started with a soft patter, then built into a steady drum. The shutters rattled. The building seemed to brace itself, creaking in a long, low rhythm. I stayed downstairs as long as I could, drinking cheap rum and pretending I wasn't watching the ceiling. The others were nervous too. The jokes were louder, the laughter sharper.

June looked at me twice across the room, the kind of look that asked a question without words. I nodded each time as if to say I was fine. I was not sure I was telling the truth. It was a reflex now, a habit of reassurance that made me feel like I was in control.

At nine, the power flickered. The lights dimmed, brightened, dimmed again. Someone groaned. Carlos lit a candle at the bar, the flame jumpy in the air. He looked at me and made a small gesture toward the stairs. It was the alert without a sound.

I stood. My backpack was already in my hand.

"I'll go get my things," I said to June.

"Do you want me to come?" she asked.

"No," I said. "I'll be quick." I didn't know why I said that. I didn't want her to see me hesitate again. I didn't want an audience for my indecision.

The hallway was darker now, the electricity gone. The candlelight from downstairs only reached the bottom of the stairs. I turned on my phone's flashlight and climbed slowly, the beam cutting a narrow path through the dark. The air smelled of wet wood and something older, a rot that lived in the walls.

Halfway up, I heard a sound. It was a crack, sharper than any creak, like a knuckle snapping. I froze. The sound came again, a long, low groan that seemed to travel through the building's spine. My skin lifted in a wave. I told myself it was the wind. I told myself it was the roof shifting. I told myself anything.

I reached the landing and felt the floor tilt under my feet, more pronounced than before. I gripped the railing and waited for the dizziness to pass. The railing was smooth and worn, carved by hands who had used it for centuries. It felt steady. It felt like something that had survived.

My door was stuck again. I lifted and pulled, my shoulder protesting. The door opened with a loud scrape. Inside, the room was darker, the flashlight beam absorbed by damp plaster. The crack glowed pale in the light, a thin river. The branch had widened. The plaster around it looked swollen, soft. The beam above it looked heavier, as if it had collected the storm in its grain.

I moved quickly, pulling my journal, my phone, my charger, the essentials I had already packed. The bag was on the bed, ready. I grabbed it and turned to leave. As I did, the room gave a small shudder. It was like a sigh, like the exhale after holding breath. Dust drifted from the ceiling and glittered in the flashlight beam.

I stopped. The sound had been small, but it had been new. The crack had looked like a promise this morning. Now it felt like a threat.

My phone buzzed in my hand. A text from my mother: "Please, Emma. Please move." I stared at it, my eyes filling in the word because my mother never wrote it like that. The storm must have made her anxious enough to type without polishing. The unpolished message hit me harder than the crack.

I stood in the middle of the room with my bag in my hand and my mother in my pocket and the ceiling above me, and I felt the split in myself widen. The version of me who stayed had a story to protect. The version of me who left had a life to protect.

Another crack sounded above me, louder this time. The beam gave a low, wood-deep groan. The room seemed to tilt another fraction, enough to make my stomach drop.

I took one step toward the door.

Then I stopped.

The thought that rushed through me was simple and stupid: if I leave now, the building will still stand and I will have been wrong.

I hate that thought. I hate that I had it. I hate that it felt like a decision.

I reached up and touched the crack again, as if it could tell me something. The plaster was damp beneath my fingertips. It was softer than it should have been. My finger sank slightly. That should have been enough.

Downstairs, someone laughed. The sound floated up, thin and bright, and it made everything feel ridiculous. The building groaned again, longer, like a warning timed to the punchline.

I stepped out into the hallway with my bag and closed the door behind me. The scrape sounded like a sentence ending. I started down the stairs, then stopped on the landing and looked back at the door. The hallway was dim, the air thick. The drip from the seam had become a steady stream, the bucket overflowing. The water crept toward the stairs, a thin line of shine.

I told myself I would move. I told myself it was decided. I told myself that being wrong about a ceiling was not a moral failure. I told myself many things as I stood there, listening to the building breathe.

Then the lights went out completely, the candlelight below swallowed by the storm.

In the sudden dark, the crack above my bed made a sound like a small, quiet laugh.
