# Chapter 31: The Weight of Waiting

The snap had been a warning shot, the first gun in a duel I had already agreed to.

The ceiling did not collapse. It only trembled, shivered like an animal shaking off water. Dust sifted through the beam of my headlamp in slow, indecent spirals. Somewhere in the wood above me, something shifted into a new position and then held, as if the building were testing how much it could move before it had to stop.

I kept my eyes on the crack and tried not to breathe too deeply. That felt reasonable, like if I didn't disturb the air with my lungs the ceiling might decide I wasn't worth the trouble.

The crack looked back. It had become a long, ugly line, darker and deeper than before, with a small knuckle of plaster hanging on by a thread. In the yellow light it resembled a mouth, one of those Renaissance cherubs with a pout, the kind that always looked vaguely disapproving. I would have taken a photo of it months ago. Now I didn't even want to remember it.

I sat up and took inventory. The way you do in airplanes when turbulence hits, as if the act of counting can prevent the crash.

Headlamp: on, dimmer than before.

Phone: still missing.

Journal: damp but readable.

Candle: floating in the water like a fat fish.

Bag: soaked, heavy, slumped against the wall.

Door: sealed.

Hole in wall: present, inadequate.

Storm: escalating.

My own heartbeat: a loud metronome, too fast.

I got off the bed and stepped into the water. It was mid-ankle now, warmer than I expected, a soup of rain and dust and whatever else had been trapped in the floorboards for decades. The movement made the bedframe creak; the beam responded with a low, offended groan. I froze, listened. The beam held. I told myself that if I kept moving slowly, quietly, the building might forgive me.

I rummaged through my bag, ignoring the way the wet fabric sucked at my fingers. Passport. Wallet. Charger. The cheap rain jacket I'd never used. A handful of coins from three countries. A packet of tissues melted into paper mush. Nothing useful. I was an archaeological dig of my own bad decisions.

The mosquito net had sagged to the floor and lay there like a discarded wedding veil. I picked it up, shaking water from it, and tried to tie it to the bedpost to get it out of the way. The knot slipped. The net fell and caught around my wrist. For a brief, irrational moment, I felt like the building was reaching for me through its props.

I forced the net into a ball and shoved it under the bed. It would be worse later, I knew, but I couldn't think beyond the next hour.

I crossed to the hole in the wall and leaned out. The rain slapped my face immediately, a sheet of needles. The courtyard below was a moving pool, white in the lightning. The broken fountain was half submerged, the white of it a pale tooth in dark water. The hammock dragged at its ropes like it wanted to climb out. Somewhere on the far side, a shutter banged open and shut, a quick, frantic blink.

"Is anyone there?" I shouted. The sound went nowhere. The wind took it, stretched it thin, dropped it in the water.

I took a breath and shouted again, louder. "Carlos!" I tasted rain and grit and something metallic. I heard nothing back. I waited, listened. The only answer was the storm, its voice too large and steady to allow mine any significance.

Lightning flashed. For a second I saw movement in the courtyard, a figure in a raincoat bent over the water. The beam from a flashlight swept across the fountain and then vanished. I opened my mouth to call again, but the rain hit harder, a wall of it, and I couldn't see the figure anymore. The silence that followed felt personal.

I pulled back inside and pressed my forehead to the wall. The plaster was cool and slightly wet. I could feel the vibration of wind through it, a tremor like a pulse. For the first time I wondered if the building could hear me. If the old wood and the adobe had some memory of all the people who had pressed their heads to these walls and asked for something. I felt stupid for thinking it. I felt stupid for nearly every thought I had had in the last twenty-four hours.

I went to the door again. It was swollen, warped, the wood darker at the edges like it had been dipped. I put my shoulder into it and pushed. Nothing. The gap didn't widen, the latch didn't creak. I put my hands on the frame and tried to lift, as if I could get leverage with my fingers. The wood bit into my palms, rough, and I yanked back. I could imagine the hallway on the other side, water and rubble and Carlos, maybe. I could imagine him trying to get in, the door resisting us both. It was a ridiculous stalemate between a teenage girl and a four-hundred-year-old piece of wood, and I knew who had the advantage.

I stepped back and looked for something to pry with. The broken rod lay half submerged, its end jagged. I picked it up and tested it against the frame. The metal bent too easily. The door did not. I let the rod fall and listened to the small splash. I would have cried if I had the energy to waste. I chose not to. I had always been good at choosing the wrong thing to conserve.

The headlamp flickered. I tapped it. The beam steadied, but I could feel its weakness. The battery would go soon. I had meant to charge it in the courtyard earlier, where the Wi-Fi was better and the outlet was by the fountain. I had meant to do a lot of things.

I sat on the bed with the journal open and tried to write. The pen scraped, the paper wet, the ink bleeding into the fibers. I wrote a list, then crossed it out. I wrote a sentence about history and deleted it with a smear of my thumb. The writing felt ridiculous, like rehearsing a speech at a funeral while the body is still warm.

I closed the journal and set it on the bed beside the candle. The candle looked obscene, a tiny cylinder of wax pretending it could hold back night. I had a lighter. I could light it. The idea of a flame in this damp, angry room felt wrong, like inviting another kind of disaster to the party.

The storm pushed at the shutters. The wind found the hole and blew rain into the room in fine, cold spray. It soaked the mattress. The bed smelled of damp metal and stale sweat. I was damp to the bone, a cold I couldn't shake.

Time did not move normally. It moved in noises: the groan of wood, the scrape of something shifting in the hallway, the thud of a tile falling somewhere else. It moved in lightning, in the sharp flashes that made the room momentarily over-exposed, every crack too bright. It moved in the way my breath sounded in my own ears.

I told myself I was waiting for rescue. I told myself Carlos had gone to get help. I told myself the door would eventually swell back to a shape that could be opened. The lies were thin, but they were the only thing that fit in the room.

I lay on the bed and stared at the ceiling. I tried to stay in the center, away from the edges where the plaster was most cracked, as if the collapse would fall in a neat, geometric pattern. The ceiling did not care about my attempts at geometry. It bowed and creaked and held. I could see the beam's underside through a ragged slit where the plaster had fallen. The wood was fibrous, pale, a sponge of decay. It reminded me of the inside of a biscuit. I did not want to be under a biscuit that weighed two hundred kilograms.

I thought about my mother. I thought about how she would read the news. I pictured her at the kitchen table, the one with the chips in the corner, phone in her hand, reading my name out loud as if saying it could change the story. I imagined her calling my father. I imagined my father opening his laptop and searching for structural collapse, looking for a way to make the physics undo the outcome. I imagined my brother texting me a meme, not knowing. I imagined the blue ticks never appearing.

The thought made my stomach clench. I rolled onto my side and pressed my face into the wet pillow. It smelled of mildew and old detergent. I breathed through my mouth because my nose was clogged with dust. Each breath felt shallow, an attempt to be small for the ceiling's sake.

A deep crack sounded somewhere to my left, a sharp, clean report like a plank snapping. I sat up instantly, heart in my throat. The sound was followed by a crash and a splintering cascade, then the thunder of something heavy settling. I held my breath, waiting for the room to follow. It didn't. The building shuddered and then went still again.

A crash in another room. A collapse close enough to make the floor tremble under me. I pictured the empty bunks in Colonial, the mattresses folding like paper, the ceiling dropping its weight into the dark. I pictured dust boiling through the hallway, filling it with a pale fog. The thought did not make me feel safer. It made me feel like a spare part in a machine that had already started to grind.

I crawled to the hole in the wall again and looked out. The rain had not eased. The courtyard water rose another inch, swallowing the bottom of the fountain. The flashlight beam had not returned. The street beyond the courtyard was black. The city had become a rumor, a suggestion. The only light was the lightning, the brief, cruel flashes that made everything look like a photograph of a place after a disaster.

I shouted anyway. "Help!" I said it until the word was nothing but sound. My voice cracked. My throat hurt. The wind swallowed it all. I sat back and wiped my face with a wet sleeve. I couldn't tell the difference between rain and tears.

The door did not open. The door did not acknowledge that I existed.

I moved to the other bunks, the ones that had belonged to other travelers whose beds now sat abandoned like shells on a beach. One had a paperback swollen into a pulp, the cover still readable: *Love in the Time of Cholera*. The irony felt too obvious, like the building was writing my jokes for me. Another had a lone sock, gray and stiff, a small evidence of someone who had left in a hurry. I held the sock for a second, absurdly jealous that someone had made it out with only a lost sock as the cost.

I stripped a sheet from the top bunk. It came away damp and reluctant, the cotton heavy with water. I twisted it into a rope, the way we'd done in school plays when someone had to escape a tower. I didn't know if it would hold my weight. I didn't know if there was anywhere to tie it. I didn't know if I would even choose to use it. I did it anyway. The strip of sheet in my hands gave me a shape to focus on, a problem I could solve, a task that wasn't just waiting.

I looped the makeshift rope around the bedpost and tugged. The knot slipped at first, then held. I tested it with my full weight, leaning back. The bed creaked. The beam groaned. I let go. The rope was a good idea in a world where the building wasn't actively trying to become a pile of rubble. In this world, the rope felt like a joke I didn't want to finish telling.

I dragged the sheet to the hole in the wall and held it out into the rain. The wind snapped it like a flag, wet and heavy. I imagined climbing down, hand over hand, the rope slick in my grip, the water below pulling at me. I imagined a bolt of lightning, the rope lighting up like a fuse. I imagined the railing giving. I imagined a lot of things. None of them ended with me standing safely in the courtyard. I pulled the sheet back inside and left it in a heap, a lifeline I couldn't bring myself to use.

My phone couldn't be gone forever. I got down on my hands and knees and felt under the bed, fingers sweeping through the cold water. The tiles were uneven. My knuckles hit the bed frame. I found the candle, wax soft and sticky. Then I felt a hard rectangle. I pulled it out and held it up.

The screen was dark. The case was cracked. Water dripped from the charging port. I pressed the power button. Nothing. I pressed it again, longer. A faint vibration, a ghost of life, and then a dim glow. The screen lit, a spiderweb of cracks. The battery was at six percent. No service. The Wi-Fi list loaded slowly, the names floating like ships in fog. CasaColonialGuest. Signal strength: one bar. I tried to connect. It spun. It failed.

I opened my messages. I wrote to my mother, the cursor blinking like a heartbeat. \"Mum, I'm okay, the storm is bad but I'm safe.\" It was a lie. I deleted it. I wrote: \"I'm stuck in my room. The door is jammed. Please call someone.\" The message sat unsent, the little arrow gray. I hit send anyway. The phone tried, a spinning circle that went nowhere. I waited until it told me it hadn't delivered. I tried again. The screen dimmed. The battery dropped to five percent.

I turned on the flashlight, but it was weaker than my headlamp, a thin white square. It felt like doubling down on a losing hand. I turned it off and held the phone against my chest, as if I could warm it back to life. I whispered into it anyway, recording a voice memo I knew wouldn't upload. \"I'm in the heritage wing,\" I said. \"Room Historia. The door's stuck. The wall is cracking. If anyone hears this, please.\" The words came out smaller than I wanted. I stopped recording when the battery hit four percent and the phone went black.

I slid the phone back into my pocket, because throwing it would have been a tantrum and I didn't have the energy. I thought about the idea of evidence, of leaving something that proved I'd been here. My journal could do that. My phone could do that. I felt ridiculous for caring. I cared anyway.

I went back to the bed and pulled the mosquito net out from under it, spreading it across the mattress like a ridiculous shroud. If I couldn't stop the building from coming down, at least I could stop the net from snaring me. I tied it to the bedpost with a knot that would have impressed my father. It still sagged in the middle. It still reached for me when I shifted. It was a literal ghost, thin and persistent.

I looked at the bunk above me. The top bunk was empty, its thin mattress damp and lumpy. I considered climbing up. I had read, once, that in collapses you're safer in a triangle, in the void created by heavy objects. The top bunk was not heavy. It was metal, hollow, a skeleton. If the ceiling came down, it would be a cage. If it didn't, it would still be a climb in the dark, with wet hands and shaking legs. I decided to stay on the lower bunk. It felt like a choice. It wasn't.

The building made another sound, lower than before. It was a groan that went on too long, the kind of sound a person makes when they lift something heavier than they should. The crack above me widened. A sliver of plaster fell, landed on my cheek. I brushed it away. The grit left a streak on my skin like makeup.

I laughed, short and sharp. It came out as a cough. "This is a liminal space," I said to the ceiling, because I couldn't help myself. "Between alive and crushed. Very on-brand." The humor was brittle. It didn't make me feel better. It only proved I was still conscious enough to make jokes at my own expense.

I felt the bed shift. The floor beneath it was giving, the old tiles loosening. The bedframe slid an inch toward the wall with the hole. I shoved it back with my feet, the metal scraping against wet tile. The sound was loud in the small room, a scream made of steel. The beam above me answered with a crack that made my stomach drop.

I froze. The crack wasn't from the beam. It was from the wall, near the ceiling, a fresh line that opened like a paper cut. The plaster flaked away. Through the crack I could see darkness and rain, a thin line of outside. The wall was opening. The building was not just settling; it was splitting.

I stood and put my fingers against the crack. The plaster was soft, wet. It crumbled under my touch. I could see the adobe behind it, the clay dark with moisture. I scraped a little, enough to widen the opening. Cold air rushed in. The outside was only inches away. The wall was only a thin skin.

The crack widened on its own with a sound like tearing cloth. I stepped back, heart hammering. The wall bowed inward slightly. A piece of plaster the size of my palm fell into the water. I stared at it, at the shape of it, at the damp, raw edge on the wall. The building was coming apart and I could see it.

I pressed my palm to my chest, as if that would hold my ribs together if the ceiling decided to join the wall. My breath was short. I forced myself to inhale and exhale slowly. The air felt heavy, wet. Every breath brought in more dust.

I sat down again, because standing made me feel like a target. I opened my journal and wrote one line: "The wall is opening." The words looked like someone else's. I wrote another line: "I can see the rain." The pen trembled. I closed the journal and pushed it away. It was evidence, not help.

Time passed, or it didn't. The storm got louder, then softer, then louder again. The building creaked in answer. The headlamp dimmed further, the light shrinking to a small, tired circle. I tapped it, and it flickered. I knew I should turn it off to save battery. I couldn't. Darkness was a weight I did not know how to carry.

There was a shuffle in the hallway, a sound like feet dragging through water. I pressed my ear to the door. I heard a voice, low and urgent, then another. I couldn't make out the words. I said my name into the wood, quietly. I said it again, louder. I banged once, twice, my fist against the door. The wood absorbed the sound. The voices receded. The hallway went silent again.

I slid down the door and sat on the floor, my back against the wood. I could feel the water against my calves. The tiles were cold. I stared at my hands, at the ink stains in the creases of my fingers, at the small scar on my knee. I thought about hockey, about running, about all the ordinary aches I had collected and survived. It felt absurd that this was how my body would fail, crushed by a building I had chosen for its vibe.

The storm outside howled, the wind a long, animal sound. The building answered with another groan, lower this time, a sound I felt in my bones. The door vibrated against my back. The floor tilted a fraction. Water flowed toward the wall crack in a slow, deliberate stream, as if the room had decided on a new lowest point.

I stood and moved the bed again, dragging it away from the wall that was opening. It moved grudgingly, the metal legs scraping. It didn't matter. The beam ran the length of the room. There was no part of the bed that wasn't beneath it. I moved anyway. It was the only control I had.

I checked the headlamp again. The battery indicator was a tiny red dot. I turned it off and stood in the dark for a second. The storm's sound swelled in the absence of light. I turned it back on. The circle of light returned, weak but there. I hated myself for it. I kept it on.

I climbed onto the bed and sat cross-legged, my back to the wall. The mosquito net hung, a thin veil between me and the ceiling. I pulled it aside, then let it fall again. I didn't know which was worse: the possibility of entanglement or the certainty of seeing the beam bowing above me.

Lightning flashed, and in that instant the room was bright as day. I saw the crack in the wall wider now, a jagged mouth, rain streaming through. I saw the ceiling sag in the center, the beam bowed, its underside split in a pale line. I saw the plaster trembling, a field of dry skin about to break. The light vanished and the room fell back into dimness. The image stayed behind my eyes like a negative.

I thought about the last Instagram post I'd made, the cracked ceiling beams, the caption about stories in the walls. I thought about how I would have defended it in a comment thread, how I would have explained that I wasn't being naive, I was being present, I was being authentic. I thought about the word "authentic" and how it had become a trap, a beautiful idea that hid the fact that sometimes the old things we love are old because no one could afford to fix them.

Another crack, this time from above, sharper, more final. I looked up. The beam shuddered. A strip of plaster fell, long and thin, landing across my legs like a ribbon. I flinched. The mosquito net snagged on my hair. I pulled it away, breathing fast. The air tasted of dust and old wood.

I stared at the beam and waited. The waiting was the worst part. Each second felt like a held breath. I could not predict the collapse. I could not stop it. I could only exist under it, in a room that had become a countdown without numbers.

Somewhere in the building, far below, a heavy crash answered the storm. The floor jumped. My bedframe rattled. The wall crack widened by another fraction, the plaster crumbling in a soft, steady fall. I could see the outside now, not just rain but the edge of the courtyard wall, the dark blur of a palm frond whipping in the wind. The building was opening itself to the storm, surrendering. I had no such opening.

I wiped my face and realized my hands were shaking. I pressed them flat on the mattress and forced them still. The shaking didn't stop; it just moved into my legs. I told myself to breathe. I breathed. It didn't help.

I laughed again, not because it was funny but because my body needed to release the pressure somehow. "This is not the story I wanted," I said to the room. "This is not the narrative arc." The ceiling did not care. It groaned, slow and deep, a sound like a tree about to fall.

I lay back on the mattress, staring at the crack that was now wide enough to see daylight if there had been any. The headlamp's beam wobbled as my breath trembled. The mosquitoes did not come; even they knew better. The room was a stage, and the set was creaking.

The storm hit the building with another hard gust, a shove you could feel. The wall with the crack moved. The beam above me flexed. A sound like a nail being pulled from wood rang out, sharp and awful. I sat up, heart slamming. The beam shifted a fraction, settling lower, and then held.

For a second, in the silence after, I thought I heard someone in the hallway, a voice calling my name. I held my breath and listened. There was only the wind. The absence was a kind of answer.

I was still waiting when the ceiling made the sound of splintering wood, long and slow, as if it were beginning to open its mouth. The light flickered. The room tilted. I stared up at the beam and realized, with a cold clarity, that this was no longer a question of if.

It was a question of when.
