# Chapter 23: The Blackout Story

The moment the headlamp died, the room stopped pretending.

The beam collapsed into a thin, uncertain glow and then went out, like a throat clearing and then deciding not to speak at all. Darkness filled the space so completely that it felt textured, like wet felt pressed over my eyes. The storm outside kept its voice, a constant, shape-less roar, and lightning stitched brief, violent images into the black: the sagging beam, the wet floor, the broken chair, my bed frame leaning like a failed crutch against the door. The flashes were too bright, too quick. In the dark between them, the room moved.

I reached up and tapped the headlamp as if it were a misbehaving light in a seminar room. Nothing. I took it off, turned it in my hands, saw only my own fingers for a split second in a flash of lightning. The battery pack was dead. The ritual of tapping a dead thing felt suddenly childish. I dropped it on the bed and listened to it land with a soft, damp thud.

I held my breath and waited for the next flash.

Lightning tore the room open. For a second I saw everything: the water on the floor shimmering like oil, the mosquito net clinging to the bed in a ghostly drape, the crack in the ceiling widened into a dark mouth, the tower of luggage and books sagging under the beam like a sculpture giving up. I saw myself too, a pale figure standing in the middle of it, hair plastered to my forehead, shirt dark with sweat, arms slightly raised as if I were going to swim.

Then it was dark again. The afterimage of the room lingered on my eyelids like a negative. I could still see the crack when I closed my eyes.

I said, out loud, to no one, "Okay." It was the only word I had, the one I used when I didn't want to use the others.

I put my hands out and walked, slow, toward the door. The floor was slick. My toes found a puddle and I nearly slipped. I touched the wall to steady myself and it was soft, damp enough to leave a ghost of my fingers. I could feel the room in pieces: the wet floor, the spongy wall, the air thick with mildew and plaster dust. The smell was stronger now, a sour sweetness like wet earth left too long in a bag.

I found the bed frame leaning against the door and grabbed it. The metal was cold. I tried to use it as a lever again, pushing down, hoping the door would give in the dark what it had refused in the light. The frame bent. The door did not. The metal made a thin whining sound, a sound like a violin string pulled too tight. I let go before it snapped and hit me in the face.

A flash of lightning and I saw the door in stark detail, the swollen wood pressed tight into its frame. It looked less like an exit and more like a seam. The building had stitched itself shut.

I banged my fist against it, once, twice. The sound felt small. I pressed my forehead to it and listened for anything on the other side. There was the storm, the building's creaks, the distant thud of something falling in another room. No footsteps. No voices. The hostel was a body and I was stuck in a rib.

I should have screamed. I didn't want to be melodramatic, which in retrospect is a very English thing to prioritize when your ceiling is splitting.

Lightning again. The crack in the ceiling looked bigger. The beam looked lower. The luggage tower looked worse. I imagined it all coming down in one slow collapse, the books that had held me up in school now failing to hold a roof up over me. I thought of the way I had made a joke about it being meta. The joke was stale now. The building did not respect my irony.

I went to the wall crack, guided by memory, and put my face close. The wind slapped rain into my cheek. The gap was wider. I could see the alley, a blur of wet stone and the dark underbelly of a balcony. The rain was so thick it erased depth. I shouted into it anyway, a raw sound that surprised me.

"Help!" I yelled. The word was ripped sideways and drowned. I yelled again until my throat burned. The wind took it all, flinging it into the night like confetti.

Another flash. I saw the courtyard below, empty, the broken fountain half-full, hammocks jerking like nervous ribs. A shape moved near the kitchen door, maybe a person, maybe a tarp. I couldn't tell. The lightning stopped and the shape vanished. I was left with the sound of rain and the taste of plaster.

I stepped back from the wall and felt the floor tilt. It was subtle but constant, like standing on a boat. The bed had slid an inch toward the wall in the last few minutes. I could feel the pull. I went to the bed and shoved it back with my hip. It moved grudgingly, the legs squealing, the wet floor taking more of the weight. It would not hold. The room was in motion.

I stood there, breathing hard, and thought of writing. My notebook was on the mattress, damp at the edges. The idea of writing in the dark was absurd, but writing was a reflex, a ritual. If I wrote it down, it was real, and if it was real, it could be controlled, or at least framed. I picked up the notebook and could not see the page. I put it down again. In the dark, my words had no place to land.

Another flash. I saw the headlamp on the bed, a dead insect. I saw my phone, screen dark. I picked it up and pressed the button. The screen lit for a moment, a tiny rectangle of light in the big dark, and then a warning: 4% battery. No signal.

I could use the flashlight, I thought. I could use the last few percent to see. But if I burned it now, I would lose it later. The logic was absurd, as if there would be a later that made more sense. I turned the screen off and held the phone anyway, the way you hold a talisman.

The storm made a new sound then, a low moan that felt closer, as if the wind had put its mouth against the building and was blowing through it. The room shuddered. The crack in the ceiling made a small snapping sound and dust fell in a soft ribbon. I blinked grit out of my eyes. The dust tasted like chalk and old bones.

I sat on the bed and pulled the mosquito net around me because it made a boundary, a pretend wall I could control. It was damp and clung to my skin. In the dark it felt like being wrapped in a cobweb. The irony of trapping myself further was not lost on me. I did it anyway.

I thought about the waiver again. The line I'd signed without reading. I thought about my name on it, the loop of my Hs, the flourish at the end that I'd done without thinking. A signature is a promise. I had promised I understood the risk. I had promised I accepted it. I had promised a lot of things that now felt like jokes.

Another flash, closer this time. I saw the ceiling bow. It was subtle, a curve where there had been a line, but it was there. I saw the crack widen, the plaster around it flaking. I saw my tower under the beam, the table legs sinking into the softened floor. The stack looked like a drunk leaning on a bar, certain it could stand until it didn't.

The dark returned. I listened to the building breathe. It was a slow, wooden inhalation followed by a groan. The sound made me think of my grandmother's house settling at night, except this was louder, angrier, the kind of groan that tells you something is giving.

I should have prayed. I didn't have the habit, and there was a stubborn part of me that refused to start out of fear. I did it anyway, under my breath, a ridiculous half-prayer with no language: Please, please, please. It felt like pushing on a door that wouldn't open.

---

At some point the lightning spread out, the flashes farther apart. The dark grew longer between them. I couldn't tell if the storm was easing or if it was simply moving into another mode, a quieter, heavier pressure. The air felt thicker. The humidity sat on my skin like a blanket left in the sun. My hair stuck to my neck. I could feel sweat under my arms, along my spine. Everything was damp: the floor, the walls, my clothes, my thoughts.

I thought about the last time I'd slept in a power outage, in a friend's parents' farmhouse in Hampshire. We had lit candles and told ghost stories and it had been charming. This was not charming. This was a room that smelled of wet adobe and rot, a room that creaked like it resented being asked to stand up.

I tried to move the mattress to the center of the room, away from the wall and the leak, as if relocating myself could relocate the risk. I grabbed the edge and dragged it, but the mattress was heavy with damp and the metal frame underneath snagged on the wet floor. The whole bed moved a few inches and then resisted, as if it was also tired of being moved around by me and gravity. I left it halfway, breathing hard, my palms slick.

I heard a scrape from the hallway. It could have been someone. It could have been the building shifting. I went to the door and put my ear against it, listening. The storm drowned everything. I hit the door with my fist, once, twice. The sound felt small and silly. I shouted this time, my voice louder than before, a thread of sound against wood.

"I'm stuck in Historia," I said. "The door is jammed. I need help." The words felt formal, like a voicemail, like something you say when you don't want to sound desperate. I should have screamed. I didn't.

No answer.

I went back to the wall crack and pushed at the plaster again, just to do something. The wall was soft, giving in chunks now. I pulled a piece away and felt it crumble in my fingers. The plaster was cool, wet, gritty. My fingernails scraped against the adobe beneath, leaving small lines. I dug with the tips of my fingers until they ached. I was trying to widen the crack to something a body could pass through, to make an exit with my hands. The wall was thick. It did not care about my hands.

Lightning flashed and I saw my fingers, smeared with gray, knuckles raw. I laughed, short and bitter. I was literally clawing at a wall. It was the oldest metaphor in the book, and I was living it.

I stopped and held my hands up to the light of the next flash. The skin was rubbed red. One nail was chipped. There was a smear of blood on my thumb. My hands did not look heroic. They looked like hands that had tried to fight a wall and lost.

I sat down on the floor because the floor was the only thing that felt stable, even as it tilted. The water pooled around me. It was cool and shallow, soaking the seat of my linen pants, making them cling. I pulled my knees to my chest and tried to breathe steadily. The storm was a wall of sound. The building's creaks were inside it, like bones cracking.

I found myself thinking, absurdly, about my Instagram caption. The one about imperfections. I imagined it now with a new caption: 400 years of stories in these walls. Sometimes the walls tell you to shut up. The humor made me laugh once, quickly, and then it died. There was no one to appreciate it.

Another flash. The beam above my bed seemed lower. The curve was more pronounced. I was not imagining it now. The crack had widened into a jagged seam, the plaster around it a lace of smaller fissures. I could see a dark void beyond, a cavity where the ceiling had separated. It looked like a mouth with a tongue of beam. I stared at it as if it might blink.

I decided to use my phone flashlight. Four percent was nothing, but I needed light. I clicked it on. A thin, cold beam emerged, weak compared to the headlamp but steady. The light made the dust in the air sparkle. It turned the room into a small circle in the night. I felt a surge of relief that was almost physical.

The beam allowed me to see the water spreading across the floor, the bed frame leaning, the wall crack gaping wider. It also allowed me to see the mosquito net tangled around the bed frame, like a net caught on a wreck. I had not realized how wrapped it was until the light. I took it down, yanking it from its hooks. It fell in a damp heap. I stepped over it, not wanting to be tangled if I needed to move quickly.

The light found the chair with its cracked leg. It found the table, the legs sinking. It found the book on top of the luggage tower, my copy of One Hundred Years of Solitude, the cover dark with damp. The book had always felt like a talisman. Now it was just another weight, a soggy rectangle doing nothing to hold a beam up.

I picked up the book and held it. The pages were wavy. I thought of the Buendias, of their circular fate, of a house that fell apart from within. I had thought I was being clever, reading it here. The joke was on me. I set the book down on the bed like an apology.

The phone light flickered once. I checked the battery. Three percent. I turned it off and then on again, as if that would change the number. It didn't. I turned it off and put it in my pocket. The darkness returned, but now I had seen the room. That was worse. It meant I knew exactly what I was sitting in.

---

I waited in the dark, breathing. The storm shifted. The building sighed. The minutes stretched. The darkness made time heavy. I tried to keep track by counting thunder. The counts blurred. I was too keyed up, too tired, too aware of every sound.

A sudden, sharp crack split the air. It came from above my head. It was not the rolling groan of settling; it was a specific, brittle snap. I felt it in my teeth. I lifted my head and looked up, even though I couldn't see. The next flash of lightning showed a new splinter in the beam, a thin line of lighter wood exposed where the darker surface had split. The crack in the ceiling had grown a finger's width.

My breath caught. This was not a warning. This was a statement.

I got up and moved away from the bed instinctively, toward the center of the room. The center felt like safety, a ridiculous belief. There was no safe place here. The ceiling was above all of it. The floor was tilting. The door was sealed. The wall was dissolving. The center was just the place where I could pretend there was choice.

Another crack. This one was lower, from inside the wall, a sound like wet wood tearing. The wall gap widened, a soft collapse. I felt a brief gust of cooler air as the rain found a new path. The sound of water changed, louder now, a slapping as it hit the floor. The room was taking on water. It felt like a slow flood, a shallow rising that didn't feel dramatic but would become one if it kept going.

I remembered the courtyard. If the fountain was filling, the whole ground level might be. I imagined the stairs, wet and slick, and felt a wave of frustration. If the door opened now, could I even get out? Would the hallway be flooded? Would the stairs be safe? The building was a puzzle that was changing as I tried to solve it.

My phone buzzed in my pocket, a small, sudden vibration. I fumbled it out and turned on the screen. No signal, but a new message queued: Are you safe? Sent an hour ago. My mother's name glowed in the dark. The battery was at two percent.

I stared at it until the screen dimmed. I typed, I'm stuck in my room but okay. Storm's bad. It did not send. The little circle spun and failed. I deleted the message, not wanting it to sit there like an accusation. I typed, I love you. It didn't send either. I left it anyway, a message in a bottle.

Two percent. I turned the phone off and held it in both hands. I imagined my mother asleep in Surrey, the rain on her window an entirely different rain. I imagined her waking up to a message if it ever went through, the calm tone I'd used, the way I'd made it sound manageable. I wondered why I was still trying to manage the tone of my own potential last words.

I went to the wall crack and pressed my face close. The wind slapped me again. The rain was relentless. Somewhere in the street a siren wailed briefly and then cut off. The sound was distant, swallowed by water. I shouted again anyway. No one looked up. The storm was a machine. It didn't care who I was.

I took the phone and turned on the flashlight for a final time. The beam was weaker now, the battery drained, but it showed me the floor: water pooled in the corners, the bed legs half in a shallow puddle, the chair floating slightly before bumping against the wall. I saw that the floorboards near the wall were darker, more saturated, and that some of the nails were rising slightly, as if the wood were pushing them out. The building was spitting its teeth.

I shone the light on the door. The bed frame was still wedged under the handle, a bent metal arch. I had an idea, desperate and stupid: I could unscrew the hinges. I had no screwdriver. I had a nail file in my toiletries bag, a thin metal thing. I found it in the dark, pulling open the bag by feel. The file was small, and the hinge screws were old, deep. I tried anyway.

The file slipped. The screw did not move. I tried another, pressed harder, felt the metal bend slightly. The file was useless. I threw it across the room and listened to it land with a small, resigned tick.

"Okay," I said, and my voice cracked. I was tired of saying okay.

Lightning flashed and I saw the beam again. I saw the crack like a canyon. I saw the sag. I saw the tower under it, my possessions piled like offerings, sinking. I saw my bed positioned right beneath it, a ridiculous altar.

I moved the bed again, pulling it toward the door, away from the beam. The bed skidded. The metal legs caught on the uneven floor. I hauled it inch by inch, my shoulders burning. It moved a foot and then refused. The tilt pulled it back. It felt like trying to drag a stubborn animal.

I left it angled, half under the beam, half not. It was not a solution, but nothing was. I sat on it, breath ragged, and listened to the building complain.

---

The storm changed again. The wind died back for a moment, and the rain became a steady, heavy fall, a curtain instead of a whip. The silence that followed the gusts felt deep. In that quiet, the building's noises were clearer: the creak of beams, the soft pop of plaster, the slow grind of wood on wood. It was a house speaking its history in the language of failure.

I could almost feel the weight above me, the centuries, the decisions, the bribes, the marketing copy that had called this wing authentic. The word tasted bitter. Authentic meant untreated beams and crumbling adobe and a waiver. Authentic meant a roof that had been asking for help for decades. Authentic meant me, with my romanticism, choosing this room.

I thought about the photo I'd taken of the crack that morning, about the caption I'd drafted. I imagined it now on a news site, screenshot, a caption in a foreign article: Tourist posted this hours before collapse. The humor was dark, and it made me laugh despite myself. It was a thin laugh, like air leaking from a balloon.

I tried to distract myself by reciting facts, the way I did in exams. Category two storm. Wind speeds. Rainfall averages. UNESCO guidelines. It didn't help. The building did not care about my facts.

The next flash of lightning showed the beam moving. It was a slight drop, an almost imperceptible shift, but I saw it. The crack widened in the same moment, a small jerk, as if the beam had decided to settle into a new position. My stomach dropped with it. I could feel the shift under my feet, a subtle lurch that made the water on the floor ripple.

I stood up without thinking and moved toward the door, away from the bed. If the ceiling fell, I didn't want to be under it. The door was there, a wall, and I stood with my back against it, as if the wood could protect me from what was above. It couldn't. I was choosing between a weight that might fall and a barrier that wouldn't open. It felt like a bad logic puzzle.

The mosquito net lay on the floor. I stepped on it and it tangled around my ankle. I cursed, tugged it free, and imagined the same net tangling me if I needed to move fast. I kicked it into the corner.

Another crack. This one was closer, sharper. A piece of plaster fell and struck my shoulder. It was light, like a slap from a hand, but it made me flinch. Dust drifted down in a slow fall, coating my hair. I brushed it off and felt grit in my palm.

I thought about running into the hallway, about calling for help, about the fact that the door still wouldn't move. I tried it again anyway. I pulled. The handle didn't budge. I slammed my shoulder into it. The door shivered but held. The frame creaked, and I heard a small, decisive sound like a nail popping. It was the door telling me to stop.

I stopped. I stood in the dark and listened to the rain.

My phone buzzed again, a pathetic little vibration. I turned it on. One percent. The message still sat there, unsent. I opened a new note and typed, If this doesn't send, I'm sorry. It was melodramatic. It was also honest. I saved it. The phone died as I hit save, the screen going black in my hands. The little rectangle of potential went dark, and with it a part of my connection to anyone else.

I held it for a moment, then put it on the bed. The room felt even darker without the possibility of light. The lightning was farther away now, slower. The flashes were less frequent. The dark between them was longer. The building's sounds filled it.

I sat on the bed, then lay down, because my legs were shaking. The mattress was damp. The mosquito net was in a heap in the corner. The bed was still partly under the beam. I should have moved it more. I didn't have the energy. I lay on my back and stared at the ceiling, even though I couldn't see it. I could feel it in my imagination, the crack like a line across my vision.

My breathing felt loud. Each inhale was a decision. I tried to breathe slowly, to keep panic from rising. My chest felt tight, not from weight yet but from fear. I thought about my mother again, about her last text. I thought about her telling me, as she always did, to be careful. I thought about my father saying buildings have latent failure. I thought about all the times I had rolled my eyes, all the times I had wanted to prove I was brave, interesting, independent.

I didn't feel brave. I felt small and very aware of the weight above me.

Lightning flashed. The beam looked lower. The crack looked wider. The plaster around it had spiderwebbed into a network of fine lines. It looked like a map of fractures, like veins in a leaf. It was beautiful in a way that made me sick.

The light went out again and I heard the sound that will probably stay with me forever: a deep, splintering groan directly above my head. It was not the general creak of a house. It was a specific, sharp tear, like a tree giving in the wind.

I rolled to my side, the movement instinctive, heart in my throat. Another crack followed, and another, a series of quick pops. Dust fell. The ceiling shivered. I could feel it, a vibration through the air.

I lay very still, listening for the next sound.
