# Chapter 26: The Splintering

Nothing fell. The silence was almost worse.

I waited, my lungs paused, my hands braced against the wet floor, for the sound of impact. The room held its breath with me. Somewhere, the storm howled and then faltered. The beam above did not collapse. It only settled with a slow, resentful creak, like a man shifting on a long train ride.

My whole body buzzed with the charge of that almost. My skin was too tight, my heart too loud. I wanted to argue with physics. I wanted to shake the beam and make it decide. Instead I sat there, my back pressed to the swollen door, and listened to the ceiling drip.

I would later think of this moment as the first time the building tested me and found me wanting. It offered me a pause. I treated it like a mistake.

---

The light came in brief slices. Each lightning flash drew the room in sharp charcoal lines: the slanted floor, the four bunks like ribs, the arching beam with its pale fracture, the jagged mouth of the wall crack. When the light went, the room erased itself again, leaving only the drip, the creak, my breathing. I took inventory in the dark because I needed to feel competent about something.

Phone: dead. The screen was a black mirror that reflected my face, smudged and gray. Power bank: dead, too, as if the storm had reached into my bag and sucked the life from it. Journal: damp but intact, the pages swelling at the edges like bread. Pen: still in my hair, because I always put it there and then spent a minute searching like a fool.

My bag sat under the bed frame, damp along the bottom. I opened it and pulled out a headlamp. I had bought it for a hike in Peru and then never used it because I hated looking like a beetle. Now it felt like an apology I could finally accept. I strapped it on and flicked it on. The light was a thin, weak beam, like a slice of moon. It was enough.

The room leapt into existence. The beam above me looked worse in full light, the crack not just a line but a shallow canyon. I could see the pale, splintered wood in its belly. I could see tiny frass, the powdery sawdust of termite work, sprinkled like dandruff along the beam's underside. I stared at it, fascinated and repulsed. It was the building's dandruff, its long-term disease made visible.

"Of course you have termites," I said, and the sound of my voice made the room feel less like a tomb. I wanted to say more, something clever about colonial decay, about empires eaten from the inside. I didn't have the energy for a metaphor, and the building didn't need one.

I dragged the mattress closer to the door again, away from the beam's centerline as best I could. It wasn't far. The room was small and the beam was long. I made my tiny island in the corner anyway, as if proximity could be measured in inches and not gravity.

I sat on the mattress and watched my headlamp's beam bounce with my breath. My chest hurt from the tension, my shoulders from the door. My knuckles were raw. I rolled my wrists and listened for the sound of feet. Nothing. The hostel had gone quiet in that exhausted way people do after panic.

The headlamp caught something on the wall, a printed waiver taped at eye level. I had signed it a week ago in the courtyard, under a ceiling fan that barely moved the air, while Carlos explained it with a tired shrug. "Solo para el ala vieja," he'd said. "Just for the old wing." I had signed without reading because I had been too busy photographing the fountain and feeling righteous about choosing authenticity.

Now I leaned close and read it. The Spanish was formal and dense. The English translation was worse, a string of legal words pasted together like a bad collage. It said I acknowledged the "rustic nature" of the heritage wing, its "historic irregularities," and that I assumed "all risks associated with living accommodations in a structure of significant age." It did not say, might crush you in your sleep. It didn't need to. That was implied in the word age, in the word risk, in my own stubbornness.

"Authentic," I whispered, and looked up at the beam again. The word felt like a taunt.

Something moved along the crack, a tiny sprinkle of dust. I held still, listening. The storm had shifted, a long exhale of wind against the shutters. The beam flexed with it, the crack widening and closing like a eyelid. The movement was subtle but it made my skin crawl. I was watching a ceiling breathe.

I took my phone and turned the flashlight on, even though it was dead. Habit is a stupid creature. I tucked it into my pocket and sat back down, the headlamp's cone settling on the bed frame like a spotlight on a sad stage.

I thought about going back to the window, about climbing onto the balcony again. It felt like the only move left. It also felt like a different kind of suicide. The storm would have to choose between me and the building. I didn't like my chances.

The beam creaked, lower now, a sound like wet wood tearing. I flinched. A thin sliver of plaster dropped from the ceiling and landed on my shoulder, cold and light. I brushed it away and it left a smear of chalk on my skin. The building was shedding.

I wanted to be someone who called for help and was rescued. I wanted to hear Carlos's voice at the door saying, "I'm here," and feel a hand on the knob, a sudden swing of light. I wanted that because it was how stories worked. The problem was I wasn't in a story. I was in a room that didn't care if I knew how to narrate.

---

The balcony looked different in my headlamp's beam. It was smaller, meaner. The wood was black with water, the iron railing slick with rain. I pushed the shutter open again and stepped onto the sill. The wind slapped my face. The air was thick with rain and sea and something sweet from the courtyard, perhaps the bougainvillea, its petals bruised by the storm.

I held the railing with both hands and eased a foot onto the balcony. The wood flexed under my weight, not much, but enough to make my stomach drop. The balcony was an afterthought nailed to the building sometime in the last century, not part of the sturdy colonial bones. It was a protest to gravity, and a damp one.

Down in the courtyard, a flashlight bobbed. Someone was moving fast, a figure in a rain jacket, head bowed. I couldn't tell if it was a guest or Carlos. I wanted to shout. I did shout. The wind tore the words from my mouth, shredded them like paper. My voice was another piece of debris.

"I'm up here!" I tried again. The words came out as a rasp. The flashlight swung across the courtyard, the beam catching the broken fountain, the hammock whipping, the puddled tiles. It passed under my balcony and kept going. The person didn't look up. I raised my arms and waved anyway, my headlamp beam wobbling like a drunk firefly. The person disappeared into the 1920s wing.

The balcony trembled as a gust hit. My hands tightened on the slick iron. The railing felt cold and old, the metal pitted from salt. The drop to the courtyard looked farther in the dark. I did the math in my head, the pragmatic, annoying part of my brain that loved to calculate: height, angle, surface. It concluded that a jump would likely result in a sprained ankle at best, a broken neck at worst, and a slip mid-jump that would put me into the fountain with its broken tile edges. I pictured myself bleeding in the courtyard while the storm drowned my cries. It wasn't better than the room. It was only different.

I considered climbing along the balcony to the corner where the heritage wing met the newer building. There might be a window, a door, a place to climb in. The balcony was narrow, the rain relentless. One wrong step and I would be falling. My body would be a small, wet fact on the tiles. The building would not collapse and everyone would say, tragically, she fell.

"I hate this," I said, and the wind snatched the words again. I crouched and scooted back into the room, pulling the shutter as far closed as it would go. It stuck halfway, leaving a crooked mouth for the rain to pour through. The room had its own weather now, a small private storm.

I sat on the floor, my clothes soaked, my hair plastered to my scalp. The headlamp's beam jittered with my breathing, painting the wall in nervous arcs. I took my journal and flipped it open to the last page I had written, the one that ended with a description of "the way the building whispers if you listen." I read it and felt embarrassed, as if I were reading a teenage poem. I tore the page out and crumpled it in my hand, then froze. It was still my journal, my only proof that I existed in this room. I smoothed the page and tucked it back. I didn't want to die without having saved at least my own words.

I tried to make the room more survivable, as if I were camping in a storm rather than trapped in a decaying dormitory. I pulled my rain jacket from the bag and draped it over the crack in the wall, pinning it with my water bottle and a paperback. It did nothing but redirect the spray to my ankle. I rolled a towel and jammed it against the bottom of the door, as if the flood would respect a damp border. The towel soaked through in seconds. The room was winning in small, wet ways.

For a moment I considered lighting the stub of a candle I had bought in a market because the vendor insisted it was "good luck." I imagined the flame, small and stubborn, and the way it would show me the ceiling in a warm glow rather than the cold headlamp. I imagined the candle tipping, the mosquito net catching, the room igniting like dry paper. I put the candle back in my bag. I did not need a fire to complete the set.

I sat again and tried to send a message on my phone as if signal could cross dead batteries. "Stuck in room," I typed on the black screen, my thumbs moving from habit, "door jammed, storm bad." The screen stayed blank. I laughed once, sharp and bitter, at the idea that my biggest problem could be a typing bubble. The laugh turned into a sigh. I pressed the phone to my forehead, cold and useless, and then shoved it deep into my bag so I wouldn't look at it anymore.

The beam creaked. I looked up again, like a dog trained to flinch at a whistle. The crack was wider. The small canyon of pale wood was now a small cliff. I could see fibers fraying. It looked like an old man's shin splintering under pressure.

I stood and moved to the bed frame under the beam, careful not to step in the pooled water that was now ankle-deep in the center of the room. The headlamp revealed the frame's bent legs and the mattress's sagging middle. I put my hand on the frame, feeling its cold, damp metal. I pressed my palm to the beam's underside, just to feel it. The wood was slick with humidity and rough with age. It vibrated faintly, a tremor running through it with each gust. It was alive in a way that made me nauseous.

"Please don't," I said to the beam. It was the most rational thing I could think to do.

The beam replied with a soft, long splintering noise. It wasn't a crack. It was a tearing, a slow sound like someone ripping fabric in the next room. I froze. A fine dust fell into my hair. I could feel it on my lips, dry and bitter.

I backed away. I watched the beam with the same focus I would give a snake. It was not a sudden threat. It was a slow, inevitable one. The building was telling me, in the only language it had left, that it was tired.

---

The storm was worse after midnight. Time had no edges, but my body knew the hour the way it knows when it needs to eat. The rain fell harder. The wind's voice deepened. The shutters rattled like bones. The wall crack spit water in small sprays. The room had become a lung wheezing itself empty.

I lay on the mattress in my corner and pulled the mosquito net over me because I wanted a thin, ridiculous layer between myself and the ceiling. The net clung to my damp skin. It smelled faintly of citronella and mildew. It made me feel like I was already wrapped for burial.

The headlamp was too bright. I turned it off, then on again. I couldn't decide whether light was comfort or cruelty. In the dark, the beam above me was a threat I could imagine, a shape I could fill with my fears. In the light, it was worse because I could see it.

I left the headlamp on and stared at the crack. My eyes began to blur. I forced them open. I told myself to stay awake. It was absurd, this idea that my wakefulness could hold up a ceiling. I believed it anyway. The building's noises were too constant to sleep through. It creaked and groaned in its own rhythm, a long, slow percussion. Each sound made my muscles tighten and then release when nothing fell. The cycle was exhausting.

I thought about the people downstairs. I thought about Carlos, wet and tired, trying to keep the roof over everyone's head. I pictured him in the lobby, the old walls shedding plaster around him, the power out, his phone lighting his face. I pictured him looking up the stairs and deciding not to come, not because he didn't care, but because he knew the heritage wing was dangerous and he didn't want to die in it too. I wanted to be angry with him. I mostly felt sympathy. This was the economy of old buildings: someone always loses.

I laughed once, a bitter little sound, when I realized I was defending him in my head while I was still trapped in his building. The laugh turned into a cough. The dust had settled in my throat like flour. I drank from my water bottle, took one sip, then stopped. I didn't want to drink too much. I didn't want to need the bathroom. The shared bathroom in the heritage wing was down the hall. The hall was beyond the door. The door didn't open. The math was simple.

I looked at my phone again. It stayed black. I pressed the button until my thumb hurt. I thought about my mother. I pictured her asleep in her bed in Surrey, the rain outside her window a polite English drizzle. I imagined her waking and checking her phone and seeing nothing. I imagined the relief she would feel if she could see me now, because at least I was awake. Then I imagined the phone call she might get later and the way her face would go still. I pushed that image away like I had pushed the shutter, as far as it would go.

The beam groaned again, a longer, lower note. The sound vibrated through the mattress. I sat up. The crack widened by a fraction, and I could see the dark inside it like a thin, patient mouth. The wall's plaster shivered, the hairline fractures branching like veins. The room itself seemed to have stretched and held, stretched and held, the way muscles do before they tear.

Something fell near the doorway, a small chunk of plaster that landed with a wet plop. The sound made me flinch. I scrambled to my feet, the mosquito net tangling my legs, and stumbled out of it. I cursed, a flat, British swear that felt weak against the noise of the storm. I untangled myself and stood there, breathing hard, staring at the beam like it was a jury about to deliver a verdict.

I moved the mattress again, another six inches, because doing something felt like breathing. The floor was slick; my feet slid. I nearly fell and caught myself on the bed frame. The metal was cold and wet. The beam above it creaked, the sound of a knee refusing to lock.

"Okay," I said. "I hear you." I didn't know who I was talking to, the beam or myself. It didn't matter. There was no one else in the room to answer.

I considered the wall crack. It had widened enough that I could see a strip of night sky, a darker blue between the rain and the building's shadow. I pushed my fingers through, feeling the wet air outside. I pushed harder, the plaster scraping my knuckles. The opening did not give. The adobe beneath it was thick and stubborn. I pressed my cheek to the opening and shouted again, my voice muffled by the wall. "Help!" It sounded pathetic. The storm threw it back at me.

Somewhere below, a crash of glass. A shout. A door slamming. The hostel was coming apart in small ways, like a ship losing its sails. I was in the oldest part, the part that had been ignoring the sea for four hundred years. The building had arrogance. It was an old colonizer with soft knees.

My headlamp flickered. I tapped it. The beam steadied. I had batteries in my bag, somewhere, but the idea of fumbling in the dark, of looking away from the crack, felt impossible. I couldn't take my eyes off the beam for long. It was the only thing that mattered, and that was a terrible, exhausting thing.

I lay back down on the mattress and pulled the net over me again. It was ridiculous, but it made me feel hidden. The rain hissed through the half-open shutter, a sound like a crowd whispering. The beam creaked. The wall crack whispered. The room was full of small, frightened noises.

I whispered back, "Please," because I had no other language left. The word sounded like a child's prayer.

---

The splintering started in earnest around what might have been two in the morning. I felt it before I heard it, a subtle change in pressure in the room, as if the air had tightened. The beam's groans deepened, becoming a series of low, wet tears. It wasn't one crack. It was many, each small and precise, as if the wood were peeling itself apart layer by layer.

I sat up, the net sliding off my shoulder. The headlamp beam cut across the ceiling. Tiny flecks of wood drifted down, spinning like snow. The crack in the beam widened a fraction with each splintering sound. I could see the fibers inside it, pale and stringy. The beam was not a single thing anymore; it was many things, all pretending to be one.

I thought of Carlos again, of his warning, of the casual way he had said, "It's more rustic." I thought of myself in the courtyard, nodding, rolling my eyes, taking a photo of the carved balustrade. I thought of the waiver and the word risk, and I felt something like shame. It wasn't useful. It was heavy.

"I'm sorry," I said aloud. I didn't know if it was to my mother or to myself or to the building. The sound of my own voice felt thin against the wood's complaint.

The beam let out a sound like a gunshot. It wasn't. It was smaller, a sharp snap, but it was loud enough that I flinched and pulled my knees to my chest. The ceiling did not fall. The beam held. It was holding on by strands now. The splintering continued, slower, a constant chewing noise. Termites, time, and rain had all been working on it for centuries. It was finally time for gravity to do its part.

I crawled toward the door again, away from the beam's center. The mattress dragged with me. The floor was slick, my hands slipping. I felt the edge of the door under my palm, the swollen wood. I pressed my ear to it and listened. Nothing. The hallway was dead or too full of storm to hear me. I knocked anyway, a soft, hopeful knock that felt absurd in the face of splintering wood.

"Anyone?" I said, the word a whisper. I didn't want to shout anymore. Shouting felt like wasting air.

I pulled back and sat with my back against the door, my knees up. The headlamp cast a cone of light that illuminated the beam and then faded into shadow. The dust in the air caught the light, floating, patient. It made everything feel underwater. The room was sinking and I was breathing through cloth.

The splintering sound changed. It slowed, then stopped. The silence that followed was a vacuum. I felt my heart flutter. The storm outside chose that moment to gust, a long shove against the walls. The beam groaned in response, a long, deep note that vibrated in my teeth. I could feel it in the door behind me, a tremor in the wood.

I closed my eyes. I told myself to stay calm. I had learned, in countless school exams, that panic made mistakes. This was not an exam. It was the building's final. I was failing it by being here at all.

The headlamp's light dimmed slightly. I tapped it again, a nervous habit. I could hear the battery inside rattling. The idea of the light going out terrified me in a childish, irrational way. I needed to see the beam so I could know when it fell, as if knowledge could make the impact gentler.

The storm quieted for a moment. In the hush, I heard something I hadn't noticed before: the faint drip of water from the beam itself, a steady patter onto the bed frame below. It was like a countdown. Each drop was time leaving.

I thought about the future I had imagined, the careful Cambridge years, the internships, the thesis, the boyfriend with the boring surname. I thought about the way I had wanted a story, something that would make me more than a list of grades and a neat plan. The universe was giving me a story. It was not the one I wanted.

The beam splintered again. A long, slow tear. I opened my eyes. The crack had widened enough that I could see through it to the darkness above the ceiling, the underside of the roof. It was black and wet and alive with rain. The building's skin had been pulled back. I was staring into its ribs.

"Okay," I said again, because it was the only word I had left. "Okay, okay, okay." I whispered it like a spell, like repetition could hold the ceiling in place.

Another sharp snap. The beam held.

I don't know how long it held. Time was smeared now, like wet ink. I watched the beam, I listened to the storm, I counted my breaths until the numbers stopped meaning anything. At some point, my eyelids began to droop. I shook myself awake. I slapped my cheeks. I muttered a curse. Sleep was an enemy now, and I was too tired to keep fighting it.

I lay down on the mattress again, not because it was safe but because my body needed to be horizontal. I pulled the net over me, my pathetic cocoon. The headlamp's beam pointed at the ceiling, its cone of light fixed on the crack like a spotlight on a guilty face. I stared up at it. The crack stared back.

The splintering resumed, a soft, steady tearing. The ceiling bowed just a fraction, too subtle to be sure, but I felt it in my gut. The beam was deciding.

In the corner of my vision, a fleck of plaster fell, drifting through the light like a slow, deliberate thought. I watched it land on my chest. I did not brush it away.

Somewhere in the building, a door slammed. Somewhere outside, the storm exhaled. Above me, the beam made a sound like a deep, careful inhale.

I held my breath and waited for the next decision.
