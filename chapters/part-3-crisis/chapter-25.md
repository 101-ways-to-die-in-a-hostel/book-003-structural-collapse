# Chapter 25: The Things That Hold

The sound above me was not a warning anymore. It was a decision.

The beam made a long, splitting sigh, a noise with a beginning and an end, like a sentence you can't take back. I felt it in the floor, in my molars, in the wet wood under my hands. The ceiling did not fall, not yet, but the room shifted as if it had exhaled too hard. Dust came down in a slow, delicate rain. I closed my eyes. The grit stuck to my lashes.

I pressed harder against the door, as if the door might take me with it if the ceiling went. The wood was damp and warm, smelling faintly of polish and rain. I could feel the building's pulse through it, a slow, patient thrum. My own heart beat faster in answer, ridiculous and human.

When the lightning flashed, I saw the beam's new fracture, a pale seam running diagonally across the darker wood. It was the color of exposed bone. The crack in the ceiling had widened into a jagged mouth and the plaster around it was webbed with thin, branching lines. The room looked tired. It looked like it had been holding its breath for centuries and had finally decided to let it out.

I whispered, "Please." I didn't know to whom. The house, the storm, whatever listens when you say please. The word was tiny. The building's sigh was enormous.

I got up because staying still felt like surrender. The mattress slid slightly under me as I stood, a slow drift toward the wall, as if gravity had given up being polite. The water on the floor had risen to a thin sheen over everything. I could hear it moving when the wind shifted, a soft slosh against the bed frame and the chair legs. The room had become a shallow canal of damp wood and old plaster.

The door still didn't move. I tried anyway, my hands on the handle, my shoulder against the panel. It gave a centimeter, just enough to tease me with possibility, then stuck again. The frame creaked in protest. The sound was not encouraging.

"Of course," I said to the door. "Of course you don't." The dark humor was thin but it was all I had. It was either joke or panic. I chose joke because it left me a second longer to breathe.

I went to the crack in the wall and put my face close. The wind slapped me, salty and wet. The alley outside was a smear of rain and stone. Somewhere below, the courtyard water sloshed. The broken fountain was just a darker shadow in a darker square. I could see the hammock tangled against a pillar, whipping like a flag. I put my mouth to the gap and shouted again.

"Help!" It came out raw and flat, swallowed by the storm. I tried again, louder. The wind took the word and broke it apart. If anyone was out there, they were not listening or they were listening to too many other disasters.

The building answered me with another creak, lower this time, and I flinched. The ceiling gave a small pop, the sound of a nail pulling out of damp wood. A small bit of plaster fell and hit my forearm. It stung like a slap from a small, dusty hand.

I wanted to blame someone. Carlos, his uncle, the bribed inspector, the travel blogger who wrote about crumbling charm, my parents for letting me go, me for needing this to be a story. Blame didn't help. The beam didn't care who I was angry at.

I knelt by the wall and pressed my fingers into the soft plaster again, because doing something was better than doing nothing. The adobe under it was wet and spongy. It crumbled under my nails, easy as cake. I pulled at it until my fingertips burned. The gap widened by a thumb's width. The rain came in faster. I had made my own situation worse in the name of escape. That felt like a metaphor I was too tired to enjoy.

I stopped and put my hands on my knees. They were gray with plaster dust, my nails packed with mud. I tasted grit when I swallowed. The air was heavy with damp and old wood. Breathing felt like drawing air through a wet towel.

I looked at the bed, at the bent bed frame by the door, at the tower of luggage under the beam leaning like a drunk, and I suddenly wanted to laugh at the absurdity of it all. My suitcase was trying to hold up a roof. My copy of One Hundred Years of Solitude was doing structural work. I had a private school education and my survival plan was a stack of literature and a wobbling table. It was darkly funny and deeply pathetic. I laughed once, a short bark, and then the laugh turned into a cough.

The cough lingered. It tasted of dust.

---

The storm changed, or perhaps I just noticed a shift in it. The wind eased for a moment, the rain settling into a steady fall instead of a sideways attack. The building's noises became clearer: the slow grind of wood on wood, the soft pop of plaster, the occasional groan that made me lift my head. Without the wind, the silence between sounds felt louder, as if the building wanted me to hear the places where it was failing.

In that brief lull, I heard a voice in the hallway. It was real, not imagined, a voice that moved with footsteps. It was a man's voice, low and fast. Spanish. I couldn't catch the words. I sprang to the door.

"Carlos?" I shouted into the wood. "I'm in Historia. The door is jammed." The words came out too controlled, as if I were asking for an extra towel. I tried again, louder. "I'm stuck. I can't open it."

The footsteps stopped. There was a pause, a small intake of air. My hope spiked like a fever. I put my ear to the door. I could hear the rain and something else, a murmur, a swear. Then the footsteps moved away, quick and uneven, as if the person had turned and run.

"No," I said. I slammed my palm against the door. "I'm here. I'm right here." I felt the uselessness of it land in my chest. The voice had been real. The leaving had been real too.

I waited, ear pressed to the wood, until my neck ached. There was nothing. The storm filled the gap. The door remained an unyielding piece of wet wood. I pressed my forehead against it and breathed, slow, because it was the only thing I could control.

The building creaked again, a long, tired sound. I stepped back instinctively. A thin line of water dripped from the ceiling now, not just from the wall. The roof had joined the leak. The drip hit the bed frame with a soft pat, steady and cruel. The sound was like a clock.

I looked at the mattress on the floor, damp and thin, and at the bed frame under the beam. There was no safe place. I dragged the mattress a few inches more toward the door, away from the beam's line, but the room was small and the beam was wide and the ceiling was above all of it. I lay down anyway, because my legs were trembling, because sitting felt like a decision and lying down felt like a pause.

I stared up at the darkness. Without light, the ceiling was a shape in my mind rather than a thing. I could still see the crack in it, a black line cut into my thoughts. I tried to remember the curve of it from the last flash of lightning. It was wider. It was lower. It was coming.

I counted my breaths because numbers were comforting. I counted to ten and then started again. The humidity made each inhale feel thick. The dust made my throat scratch. My breath rasped in the quiet.

The storm's lull ended. The wind returned like a hand slamming a door. The shutters rattled. The wall shuddered. The room tilted and the water shifted, a slow wave across the floor. I felt the mattress move beneath me, sliding a fraction toward the wall. I grabbed the edge and pulled it back. It barely moved. The room had its own momentum now, and I was a small thing in it.

There was a crash from somewhere below, a heavy sound that made the walls tremble. It could have been a shelf, a window, a table, a piece of the building itself. The thought made me sit up. I pressed my ear to the door again. I heard voices below, raised, urgent, a chorus of Spanish and one thin English "Oh my God." The hostel was not asleep. It was in its own crisis. I was not the only one trapped in a bad story. I was, however, the only one trapped in this room.

I banged on the door again, a rhythm with my fists. The wood hurt my knuckles. It was a cheap pain compared to the weight above me. I kept knocking anyway, as if persistence could change the angle of a swollen frame.

"Please," I said into the crack, my mouth pressed to the wood. The word fogged the seam. It felt childish. It was honest.

No response.

I sat back and let my head thud against the door. The sound was small. The door absorbed it like it had absorbed everything else.

---

Time did not behave. The storm kept falling, the building kept shifting, and my sense of minutes turned to mush. I tried to measure time by lightning and thunder, by the drip on the bed frame, by the way my hands cramped when I held the edge of the mattress. It didn't help. Time in fear is a loop.

I thought about my mother again, because thinking about her made me feel like I had a lifeline, even if it was imaginary. I pictured her kitchen, the kettle whistling, the mug she always used. I pictured the way she rolled her eyes at my captions, even when she pretended to read them. I pictured her telling me to check the exits, to read the waiver, to take the newer room. I had wanted her to be wrong because I wanted to be interesting. It was an embarrassing thing to want now.

The beam above me creaked. The sound came deeper, closer, as if it had decided to speak in a lower register. I sat up. I waited for the next sound. It came: a short, sharp pop. I felt the air shift. Another pop. Another. The beam was breaking itself down into smaller decisions, each one a tiny surrender.

I did a ridiculous thing. I crawled toward the beam and put my hand on the bed frame under it, as if I could feel the vibrations and somehow reason with them. The metal was cold. It hummed faintly with the building's movement. The beam above it felt like a living thing, a long muscle flexing under too much strain. I pulled my hand back as if it could burn me.

"Okay," I said, and the word sounded useless. "Okay, fine. Not under there." I crawled back to the door, dragging the mattress a little with me, creating my small island again. The mattress snagged on a nail that had lifted from the floor. It ripped the fabric with a soft tear. The building was eating my escape routes, one thread at a time.

Lightning flashed. The room lit up in sharp blue. For a second I saw everything: the beam's diagonal fracture, the crack widening like a grin, the wall gap yawning open, the water pooled across the floor, the bed frame like a ribcage. I saw myself too, curled against the door, hair damp and plaster-streaked. I looked like a child hiding from a storm. It made me angry. It made me want to stand up and do something that mattered.

I stood up. I picked up the bed frame, bent and useless, and heaved it toward the door like a battering ram. It struck the wood with a dull thud. I hit it again. The frame bent more. The door did not move. The impact made the beam above groan, as if I had shaken the wrong part of a fragile thing. I stopped, breathing hard. My arms trembled. The door stayed shut.

I leaned against it, panting. The air smelled of wet wood and stale sweat. The dust in my hair felt gritty. The dark humor in my head was a list of things I would have done differently if I were a character in a horror film: I would have left when the first crack appeared, I would have taken the safe room, I would have been boring. I would have listened to the person in the beginning who says, "Don't go in there." But I was in there. I had walked in and shut the door behind me.

The storm roared again, a fresh surge. The shutters rattled, the walls flexed, and the floor seemed to tilt a fraction more. The water on the floor slid across my toes. I stepped back and felt the cold seep into my skin. The building was becoming a shallow river, and I was a stone in it.

There was another sound, a deeper crack that felt like it came from within the beam, not just along its surface. It was a bone-snap noise, sharp and final. I froze. The building held. I waited for the collapse and it didn't come. The delay was almost worse. It meant the beam was still deciding. It meant I was still waiting for the decision.

I didn't trust my own control anymore. I crouched by the wall crack and peered out again. The rain had eased a little. I could see more of the courtyard now, the water pooled around the fountain. A figure moved below, a person with a flashlight, running across the tiles. Their light swept the courtyard and briefly caught my face through the gap. I lifted my hand and waved, frantic. The person didn't look up. The light swung away. I watched it leave like the last train.

"Of course," I said. "Of course you don't see me." The words were a bitter whisper. The storm answered with another gust.

I tried to pry the wall open more, as if I could make an exit big enough for a body. The plaster crumbled in wet chunks. The adobe beneath was thicker, packed and stubborn. My fingers were raw. The hole widened by a few centimeters, not nearly enough. I stopped when I felt blood on my thumb. The wall was not going to open for me. It was only going to collapse when it was ready.

I sat with my back against the wall and looked at my hands. They were gray and red, scraped, nails broken. They looked like the hands of someone who had worked. It was a kind of work, I supposed, the work of trying to live.

---

I decided to stop being polite to the door.

There was nothing left in the room that could be broken without making the situation worse, but I did it anyway because desperation is a terrible engineer. I dragged the bent bed frame away from the door and flipped it onto its side, hunting for a straight bar. The metal was hollow, thin, cheap. I pulled at one of the crosspieces until it snapped loose with a shriek. The sound made me wince. The beam above responded with a resentful creak, as if to say, try me.

The bar was lighter than I expected, a flimsy thing that made me feel more ridiculous than hopeful. I wedged its end under the door handle and pushed down, using it like a lever, like I had seen people do in films when they were trying to pry a door. The bar bent immediately, its cheap metal whining. The door did not move. I tried again, putting my weight into it until my shoulders burned. The door held. The bar bowed, then slipped and snapped back against my shin. I yelped. The pain was sharp and petty. I wanted something dramatic, something that would justify the effort. All I got was a bruising line and a reminder that the room was winning.

"Great," I said, limping. "Love that for me." The dark humor tasted bitter, but it kept me from crying. I had not cried yet. I wasn't sure I would. There was no air to waste on tears.

I considered the hinges. Old doors in old buildings can be removed if you can access the pins, if you have a screwdriver, if you have time. I had none of those. I had a broken metal rod and a hair tie. I tried anyway, because the part of my brain that went to Cambridge debates was still convinced that effort was a substitute for outcome.

I jammed the rod at the hinge seam and twisted. The metal slipped, the rod scraping along the doorframe. I tried again, and again. The hinge didn't budge. The wood around it gave a little, swollen and soft, as if it might crumble around the metal. I froze, thinking about the wall, about making another hole and making another leak. I pulled back. The building did not need my help to fail. It was doing fine.

The window was the only other option with edges. I went to it and put my hands on the shutter. The wood was swollen, reluctant. I pushed and felt it yield a fraction, a reluctant opening. The hinge squealed like a complaint. Rain blew in and smacked my forearm. I pushed harder. The shutter opened another inch and then stopped, held by the warped frame.

I put my shoulder against it and shoved. The shutter groaned and opened just enough for me to see the outside clearly. The balcony's edge was slick and narrow, a strip of rotting wood with a black iron railing. The rain turned it into a shine. The drop to the courtyard was not huge, but it was enough to break something, enough to make me a different headline.

I swung one leg onto the sill and felt the cold air wrap around it. The wind yanked at my hair. The storm smelled of salt and wet stone. For a moment, the outside felt like freedom. It also felt like a trap. The balcony was narrow, the railing slick, and the storm was tugging like a child trying to pull you into a game you didn't agree to play.

I put my hands on the wet iron and leaned out. The courtyard below was a glittering sheet of water. The broken fountain overflowed. A hammock thrashed against a pillar like a trapped animal. I imagined dropping down, running across the tiles, slipping, cracking my head. I imagined doing it anyway because at least it was movement, at least it was a choice.

Another gust hit and the shutter slammed against my back. I flinched and almost lost my balance. I grabbed the iron railing with both hands, my knuckles white. The wind tore the breath from my mouth. I pulled myself back inside and closed the shutter as best I could. It didn't close all the way. It didn't matter. The rain kept coming in.

I sat on the floor and laughed once, a short burst that came out wrong. I had looked at the outside and found another kind of danger. The building had trapped me in a room and the storm had trapped me in a city. It was a nested problem, a set of boxes that all said not this way.

I pressed my forehead to my knees and breathed. The air smelled of wet wood and the faint metallic tang of my own blood. My shin throbbed. My fingers hurt. My wrists ached from levering against the door. I was tired in a way that felt cellular.

Somewhere below, a door slammed. A voice shouted again, this time closer, followed by a rush of footsteps. I lifted my head, heart hitching. I banged on the door, more frantic now, the heel of my hand stinging. "I'm up here!" I shouted. "Historia! Please!" My voice cracked. It did not feel academic anymore. It did not feel composed. It felt like exactly what it was: fear, plain and unqualified.

The footsteps ran past. I could hear them on the stairs, the wet slap of shoes. They did not stop. They did not come up to me. I pressed my ear to the door and heard only the storm and the building's steady, exhausted creak. The people downstairs were trying to survive their own disaster. I was not their priority. I hated them for it and understood them in the same breath.

I slid down the door and closed my eyes. I imagined a version of myself in a different room, in the newer wing, dry and bored and safe. I imagined her reading in bed, hearing the storm and thinking, glad I took the modern room. I tried to step into her mind, to borrow her calm. It didn't fit. I had made choices that had led to this room, this night, this door. The building was not interested in letting me pretend otherwise.

I opened my eyes and stared at the dark. The lightning had slowed. The gaps between flashes were longer. The darkness felt heavier. My body felt heavy too, as if the weight above me was already pressing. I kept waiting for the sound of the beam to go, for the crash, for the end of this prologue. It kept not coming. The anticipation was its own kind of collapse.

I told myself to stay awake. I told myself that if I slept, the building would choose that moment to fall. I didn't know if it was true, but it felt like a rule, and rules were all I had.

---

The building shifted again. It was subtle but sudden, a small lurch that made the water on the floor ripple. The door groaned in its frame. Somewhere below, a voice shouted. It was a single word, sharp and scared. I couldn't make it out, but I heard the fear in it. It was echoed by my own, a mirror I didn't want to see.

The lull in the wind returned, the storm taking another breath. In the quiet, I could hear the drip from the ceiling more clearly, and beneath it, another sound: a faint, rhythmic creak from above, like a hammock swaying. It took me a moment to realize it was the beam moving, flexing with each small gust. The beam was rocking. The idea of it moving was worse than it moving itself.

I closed my eyes and tried to picture the building as it had been, centuries ago, when the beam was new, the adobe dry, the courtyard full of people who had no idea their ceiling would someday decide a nineteen-year-old English girl. I imagined a merchant's house, candles, a family eating dinner. I imagined the beam then, straight and proud. It felt like I was trying to conjure a different timeline. It did nothing. The beam did not care about its past. It cared about gravity.

The rain intensified again. The wall crack shuddered and I felt a spray of water across my face. The wall gave another inch, a small crumble. The gap widened enough that I could push my forearm through it. The plaster scraped my skin. I could feel the wet air outside. I could not fit my shoulder. The opening was still a promise, not a path.

I pressed my cheek to the damp edge and breathed. The outside air smelled of rain and street dust and something faintly floral, maybe the bougainvillea I had admired earlier in the day. The smell made me ache in a strange, homesick way. It smelled like summer and life. The air inside smelled like old wood and mildew and fear. I wanted the outside. I could not have it.

I thought about my phone again, dead and useless. I thought about my last message drafts, the unsent "I'm okay" and "I love you" and "I'm sorry" sitting in a dead device. There was something obscene about them, a little list of regrets tucked into a black screen. I pictured my mother waking to no reply. I pictured her checking the news, her face tightening. I pushed the thought away because it was unbearable.

The beam above me made a sound like someone cracking a thick stick. I jumped to my feet. The room went quiet for half a second, the storm holding its breath. Then came another crack, deeper, closer. The beam had begun to split in earnest. I could feel it in the vibration of the floor, a ripple traveling through old wood and water. The ceiling dust fell in a thicker sheet. I coughed, eyes watering, and tasted the old building on my tongue.

I backed against the door again, palms pressed to the wood. I could feel my own pulse in my wrists. The door did not open. I pressed anyway, as if pressure could make a miracle.

The wind surged. The shutters rattled. The wall shuddered. The beam groaned in a long, tortured note. The sound was so loud it was almost a voice. It went on and on, longer than any creak should. I thought, this is it, and then it wasn't. The beam held. It held again, stubborn and proud and exhausted.

The waiting was a kind of torture. It was the worst version of suspense: the threat had become a presence, but it was still choosing when to strike. Every second felt like a borrowed one. My body trembled with the effort of being ready. My lungs felt tight. I realized I had been holding my breath and let it out in a long, shaky exhale.

I slid down the door again, because my legs were shaking too much to stand. The water on the floor had risen to my ankles. It was cold. It made my skin goosebump. I wrapped my arms around my knees and stared at the dark. The building creaked. The storm roared. I waited.

Lightning flashed, a brutal strobe. In that split second I saw the beam's fracture widen, a line opening like a mouth. I saw the ceiling bow, the plaster around the crack crumbling. I saw the bed frame beneath it, waiting. I saw my own face reflected in the wet floor, pale and blurred. Then the light was gone.

In the dark, the beam made a soft, final-sounding pop.

I held my breath and listened for the sound of falling.
