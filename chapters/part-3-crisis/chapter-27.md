# Chapter 27: The Holding Pattern

The crash didn't come. The waiting did.

I had braced for the sound of falling, the sudden release, the end of the suspended moment. The beam made its soft, final-sounding pop, and then the room stayed exactly as it was: wet, dark, tilted, and breathing. The storm didn't pause to be dramatic. The rain kept hitting the shutters with the indifferent persistence of a metronome. The drip from the ceiling kept time. My heart kept time. The building kept time. It was just a different kind of sentence, one with too many commas.

I realized my jaw hurt from clenching. I forced it open. My mouth tasted like plaster. The muscles in my legs were trembling with the effort of being ready for something that refused to arrive. I shifted on the wet mattress, and the cold water sloshed, a tiny wave around my hips. The floor had become a shallow tide. I felt ridiculous, a girl in a heritage dorm waiting for gravity to make a choice.

"Okay," I said again. The word was tired now. It felt like rubbing a penny between my fingers to make it warm.

The headlamp's beam jittered as I moved. Dust hung in the air like a slow snowstorm. The beam above me was still cracked, still bowed, still in the process of deciding. The fracture looked wider than it had a minute ago, which was either true or my eyes playing tricks from exhaustion. I couldn't trust anything anymore except the sound of the rain and the weight of the air.

I forced myself to stand. If I was going to die here, I didn't want to do it curled up in a wet nest like a sad animal. I wanted to be upright, aware, prepared. That felt like a better story. It was a stupid thought, but it was mine.

I pulled my journal out of my bag. The pages were swollen and wavy with damp. The spine was soft, the ink already smudged on the last few lines. I flipped to a dry page and held the notebook against my knee to write. I had a pen. I always had a pen. The pen was the only reliable thing in this room.

I wrote: "If this is it, then it is the most inconvenient death I can imagine. Please note that I was right about the building being historically significant and wrong about it being safe." I stared at the sentence. It was smug. It was mean. It was also, in a dark and petty way, truthful. I flipped to the next line and wrote, "Tell Mum I am sorry." The pen stopped. The ink blurred. I pressed too hard and tore a tiny hole in the page.

I didn't want to be melodramatic. I was allergic to melodrama. I had always described myself as stoic, pragmatic, not one for tears. But there was something humiliating about the room itself, about the way it made me small. I could not be stoic in a room that was actively trying to eat me. I could only be present.

The beam creaked, a low groan that was more vibration than sound. I froze, pen still in my hand. I looked up and watched the crack, the pale belly of the wood exposed like bone. Another tiny sprinkle of dust fell into my hair. I blinked and kept writing because if the ceiling wanted to fall, it would fall whether or not I was journaling.

I wrote: "I am in Historia. The door is jammed. The wall is open to the rain. The storm is loud enough to swallow a scream. The beam is deciding." That felt too poetic, too much like a line I might have captioned under a photo. I crossed it out, because perhaps the only thing I could control was my own self-dramatizing.

Then I stopped. The pen hovered. There was no one to read this in time. The idea of a future audience was suddenly irrelevant. The journal was not going to save me. It might outlast me, like the building had outlasted everyone who built it. That was its own kind of cruelty.

I slid the journal back into my bag. My fingers were stiff from cold. I tucked the bag against the wall, away from the worst of the drip, as if the bag could be protected when I could not.

A sound came from the hallway. I jerked toward the door. It was not a voice this time, but a scraping, a dragging sound, like something heavy being pulled across wet tiles. A chair. A table. A body. My stomach dropped. I pressed my ear to the door.

"Carlos?" I whispered. The door was damp and warm against my cheek. "Is anyone there?"

The dragging sound stopped. I held my breath. The storm filled the space with noise. No answer. I wanted to bang, to shout, but I was afraid the beam would answer instead. The old wood above me felt like a temperamental animal. I didn't want to poke it.

The dragging started again, farther away this time, the sound fading down the hall. It wasn't coming for me. Whatever was happening outside, it was happening without me.

I backed away from the door and looked at the wall crack. It had widened again, the plaster around it crumbling in soft clumps. I could see the outside more clearly now: a ragged strip of night, a smear of rain, the dark outline of the balcony. The hole was not big enough to climb through. It was big enough to see how close freedom was and how far away it remained.

I pressed my hand to the edge and scraped. The plaster was soft, like damp chalk. It crumbled under my fingertips, leaving my nails packed with gray paste. The adobe beneath was firmer, dense, the consistency of a stale brick. I chipped at it anyway, because it was something to do that wasn't waiting.

Each scrape loosened a little more plaster. Each scrape made the hole slightly bigger. The rain came in faster, the wind bringing it sideways in stinging sprays. My knuckles were raw. My wrist ached. I kept scraping.

A gust blew and I had to close my eyes. When I opened them, the headlamp's beam wobbled. I lifted my hand to steady it. The strap was damp, slipping. The battery was weakening. I could feel the light thinning at the edges, its circle shrinking. I was on a timer now.

The building creaked again, deeper. I stopped scraping and held still. The beam above me made a low, mournful sound, like a ship's hull under strain. The ceiling bowed a fraction, then held. The noise was the building's answer to my impatience: not yet.

"Fine," I said. The rain hissed on my cheek. The wind stole the word.

I went back to the door and put my hands on the handle. It didn't move. I tried again, using my shoulder, the way I had a dozen times. The door stayed shut, swollen into its frame as if it had grown there. I leaned my forehead against it and closed my eyes. The wood smelled like old polish and mold. It smelled like the inside of a library that no one had visited in years.

I imagined the corridor beyond, the other rooms in the heritage wing, empty now. I imagined the 1920s wing, newer and sturdier, lit by flashlights and phone screens, the guests huddled together in damp blankets, the staff doing their best. I imagined them talking about me in that vague way you talk about a problem when you don't know how to solve it: "La chica inglesa en Historia." The English girl in Historia. I was a rumour. I was a possible mess for later.

I had never been a rumour. I had always been a person who could RSVP and show up and be in the room. I didn't know how to be absent.

The headlamp flickered again. I tapped it. The light steadied, but the beam looked smaller. The dust in the air was thicker now, the particles catching the weak light and hovering like tiny planets. I found myself watching them, the way they drifted, the way they fell, and the way they didn't seem to mind where they landed. They were patient. They would be here long after I wasn't.

There was another sound from the hallway, a muffled shout in Spanish, a word I couldn't quite catch. I put my ear to the door. The voices were closer now, urgent, overlapping. I could pick out "abajo" and "cuidado" and something that sounded like "techo" (roof). They were talking about the ceiling. They were not talking about me.

I opened my mouth to shout and then closed it again. If I shouted, if I forced them to come, would they risk the heritage wing? Would they come to a door they couldn't open? Would they stand under my beam? I imagined Carlos at my door, the key in his hand, the ceiling falling as he tried to help. The image made me nauseous.

I didn't shout. I hated myself for that, for the pride, for the guilt, for the quiet.

When the voices moved away, I felt the room grow bigger again, the emptiness stretching out around me. The storm hammered on the shutters. The water on the floor shifted, a slow tide. I leaned back against the door and slid down until I was sitting in the shallow water, knees up, arms wrapped around them. The water seeped into my shorts. It was cold enough to make my teeth chatter. It was also a reminder that I was still alive. You can't feel cold if you're dead.

I tried to think about Cambridge. It felt like a fake future now, a postcard from a place I might never reach. I tried to think about my brother's stupid jokes. I tried to think about my mother's voice. It was all too far away. The only thing close enough to touch was the wet wood, the damp plaster, the narrow strip of night through the wall.

The storm shifted again. The wind eased. The rain softened to a steadier fall. In the quiet, I could hear the building in a different way. There was a low grinding from below, as if a wall had shifted and was settling into a new position. There was a soft creak in the beams overhead, a constant whisper of wood on wood. The building was moving. The building was tired. The building was not done.

I stood and went back to the wall crack. I used both hands now, my fingers digging into the plaster, pulling it away in wet chunks. The hole widened by another few inches. I could see the balcony's edge, the iron railing, the rainwater pooling along its lip. I could put my hand through, then my forearm, then my shoulder. The opening scratched my skin, the plaster gritty against my arm.

I pushed harder and felt the adobe give a little, a soft crumble. The wall was not a wall so much as a damp loaf. The rain was eating it from the outside. I was helping from the inside. We were meeting in the middle.

The hole was big enough now that I could fit my head through if I turned sideways. I hesitated. The wind tugged at my hair. The rain hit my face. The smell of outside was sharp and alive: salt, wet stone, something sweet from the courtyard. It felt like breathing after being underwater.

I twisted and stuck my head through. The rain slapped my cheek. I could see the courtyard more clearly now, a wide, gleaming square of water. The broken fountain overflowed, its stone mouth spilling into the puddles. The hammock was tangled around a pillar, soaked and heavy. The tiles glinted in the headlamp's faint light, slick and dangerous.

A flashlight bobbed across the courtyard, moving fast. The light passed beneath me and swept up the wall. It stopped. It caught my face.

"Hey!" I shouted, hoarse with dust. "I'm here! I'm in Historia!"

The light froze. A voice shouted something I couldn't understand. It sounded like a question, then an answer. The light flicked away, then back. I waved my arm through the hole. The plaster scraped my elbow. I didn't care.

"I'm stuck! The door's jammed!" I shouted. My words were lost to the wind, broken apart before they hit the courtyard. I shouted anyway, because the light was on me, because I could see another person moving now, because I wanted to be a person rather than a shadow.

The light dipped, then lifted again. I saw a figure in a rain jacket look up, their face turned toward me for a second. I couldn't tell if it was Carlos. The face was too far away and the rain was too heavy. The person raised an arm, a vague gesture, maybe a wave, maybe a warning. Then the light swung away and the figure ran toward the 1920s wing.

I stared after them. The light disappeared into the doorway. The courtyard fell dark again. The rain resumed its dominance. I was left with the hole, the wet wall, the empty night.

"No," I said. It came out as a croak.

I kept my head in the hole, rain dripping down my neck, waiting for the light to come back. It didn't. The wind shifted again, and I had to pull myself back inside as the rain began to blow in sideways. My hair was plastered to my scalp. My clothes were heavy. I wiped my face with my sleeve and tasted salt and dust.

The brief moment of being seen left a strange ache. It was like being touched and then let go. I had been a person to someone for a second, and then I was just a problem again. A room. A door. A risk.

I looked at the hole and considered climbing out. It was bigger now. With effort, with pain, with a lot of scraping skin, I could maybe wedge myself through. The balcony was slick. The rain was relentless. The drop was not lethal but it was not kind. I imagined myself halfway through the wall, stuck like a cork, the building shifting and the plaster pinning me. I imagined myself slipping from the balcony, falling into the courtyard and breaking my ankle, still stuck in this storm but in a different place. The image did not feel like escape. It felt like another trap.

I pulled back and sat on the floor. The water pooled around my hips. The cold made my skin numb. I hugged myself and rocked a little, the way you might on a long bus ride when you can't get off. I was not crying. I was not calm. I was just here, in the in-between.

The headlamp flickered again. This time it dimmed and stayed dim. The battery was dying. The light was turning from a beam into a glow, like a candle that had been burning too long. I didn't have the energy to find the spare batteries in my bag. I didn't want to look away from the ceiling for that long. I didn't want to turn my headlamp off and put myself in the dark.

I thought about the candle in my bag. I thought about lighting it. The idea was almost funny now, like a ritual at the end of the world. I could imagine the flame wavering in the draft, a tiny, stubborn thing in a room that might fall. It would make everything more dramatic. It would make it more like a story. I did not light it.

Another sound from above made me look up. The beam had shifted again, a new splintering noise, slow and steady. The crack widened just enough for me to see deeper into the wood. The fiber inside looked frayed, like wet rope. The beam had the texture of old bread, of something that could be pulled apart by hand.

I stood, because I didn't trust myself to stay seated when the ceiling might fall. I moved the mattress a few inches again, my useless ritual. The mattress dragged through the water with a slurp. The corner snagged on a floorboard and tore. The stuffing inside looked like wet wool. The bed was falling apart too. Everything in this room was failing in sympathy.

I went back to the door and pressed my ear against it. The hallway was quieter now. The voices were gone. The building's sounds were louder. It was like being alone in a sleeping animal, listening to its joints.

I took the metal rod from earlier, the bent piece of bed frame, and jammed it under the door again. I pushed. The rod bent further. The door gave a millimeter, then held. I pushed until my arms shook. The rod slipped and slammed against the floor, splashing water. I cursed, a short, furious sound that surprised me.

"I hate you," I said to the door. I meant the building. I meant myself. I meant the storm. It didn't matter.

I dropped the rod and sat on the mattress, which was now damp and lumpy and useless. The headlamp's light shrank another notch. The dust in the air became harder to see. The room was fading, the details dissolving. The ceiling was still there, still above me, still cracked, still waiting.

I saw the waiver again, the sheet of paper taped to the wall near the door, its edges curled from damp. The headlamp's weak glow made it look like a small flag of surrender. I stood and peeled it off, the tape resisting, then giving. The paper was slick. The ink had bled in places, the letters swelling like they were drowning.

I read it anyway. The Spanish version was crisp enough to make my brain work; the English translation was the same legal soup I remembered. \"Rustic irregularities.\" \"Historic variability.\" \"Assumption of risk.\" It was a poem about negligence if you read it with the right eyes. I had signed it with a loop of a pen, my name neat and confident. My signature had not smudged. It was still smugly intact.

I laughed once, a thin, wet sound. \"Assumption of risk,\" I said. \"Assumed.\" The paper was heavy in my hands, a damp rectangle of my own stupidity. I folded it and shoved it in my pocket. It felt like a relic, a souvenir from a decision I couldn't undo.

The storm quieted again. In the lull, I heard the distant church bells, muffled by rain, a slow, solemn ring. Cartagena's old bones were singing to themselves. The sound made me think of Day of the Dead, of the sugar skulls I'd seen in the market earlier that day, of the vendor who had pressed a bright paper marigold into my hand and said, \"Para la suerte.\" For luck. I had tucked the paper flower into my bag and forgotten about it. The paper flower was likely soggy and limp now, a small yellow pulp. I wanted to laugh at that too. Everything in my bag was becoming what the room was: wet and soft and useless.

I pulled the paper flower out anyway. It was a wilted star, the edges curling, the yellow darkened to a sickly gold. I set it on the mattress beside me, a little flag of color in the gray. The absurdity of it made my chest ache. If I made it out, I thought, I would never dismiss cheap paper luck again. I would take all the talismans people offered me. I would be superstitious and grateful and boring.

A small movement near the wall caught my eye. The headlamp's dim light revealed a gecko clinging to the damp plaster, its toes splayed, its body translucent in the weak glow. It blinked once, slow and calm, then darted into the crack and disappeared. The gecko had found a way out. I watched the empty space it had left, feeling a strange spike of envy. Even the gecko could leave.

I pressed my hand to the wall again, feeling the cool wetness of the plaster. It yielded slightly under my palm. The building was softening around me, dissolving, and yet it was still strong enough to hold me in place. That was the cruelty of it: the building could fail without freeing me. It could collapse in the worst possible way, crushing instead of opening.

I thought about the tourists downstairs, about the ones who had chosen the newer wing. They were probably wet and scared, but they were together. They could reach the courtyard. They could leave if they had to. I was alone in the oldest part of the building, where history did not want to let go. The irony was almost too clean. I had wanted an authentic experience. The building was giving me one in the form of its actual age, its true weight. This was history, not a caption.

I put my head in my hands and breathed, counting to ten, then to ten again. The numbers were a rope. I held them tight. I told myself that if the beam fell, it would be quick. That was a lie, and I knew it. The death was not quick. I had read about crush injuries. I had written an essay in sixth form about a mining disaster. I knew exactly how long it could take to stop breathing when your chest was pinned. Knowing did not help.

I sat up and looked at the ceiling again. The beam was a long, dark shape now, the crack a pale line. I imagined the termites inside it, their invisible work, the way they had eaten from within until it looked solid but wasn't. It felt like a metaphor for privilege, for things that look stable on the outside while the inside is hollow. I had written something like that once, in a draft blog post that got too many likes. It felt less clever now. It felt like the beam was making a joke at my expense.

The headlamp flickered once more. The light was barely enough to read by now. It was a dim pool on the floor, the ceiling beyond it a darkness full of shapes I could only guess. I was losing the ability to watch the crack, which felt like losing my last illusion of control. I pulled the headlamp off and held it in my hand, tapping it, willing more light out of it. The beam sputtered and steadied, then weakened. There was nothing left to coax.

I put the headlamp back on, its weak circle pointing at the ceiling. The room was a cave again. I sat on the mattress with the soggy paper flower beside me and waited, listening to the storm, the drip, the soft grind of wood. My eyes hurt from staring. My shoulders ached. My jaw ached. Everything ached in small ways that added up to exhaustion.

I thought about all the times I had insisted I didn't need help. I thought about all the essays I'd written on resilience, all the speeches I'd given on privilege, all the righteous takes about authenticity and experience. They felt like costumes now, wet and heavy. I was not immune to physics. I was not special. I was a body in a room with a bad ceiling.

The storm eased again, and for a moment the quiet was so complete I could hear my own heartbeat. It was a steady, stubborn drum. It did not want to stop. It was the most honest sound in the room.

Then the beam made a sound that was different from all the others. It was a sharp, clean crack, a gunshot in wood. The room shuddered. Dust fell in a thick sheet. The headlamp's light flashed across the ceiling, and I saw the beam split further, the crack opening like a mouth.

I froze. I waited for the fall. It didn't come. The beam held, but it had given another inch of itself. The room was one step closer to the sentence ending.

I let out a breath I didn't know I had been holding. It was long and shaky. I sank to the floor, my back against the door, my hands trembling. The water lapped at my calves. The dust coated my face. The beam above me creaked, a slow, tired sound.

I looked at the hole in the wall. The outside was still there. The rain still fell. The courtyard was still empty. The light did not return. I was in the room, and the room was in me now, its damp and its weight, its slow, inevitable decision.

The headlamp sputtered and dimmed again. The circle of light shrank to a weak, uneven glow, barely reaching the ceiling. The rest of the room dissolved into shadow. The crack was there, but I could only see its edges now. It was like watching a mouth in the dark.

The storm held its breath. The building held its breath. I held mine too, because I didn't know what else to do.

And somewhere above me, the beam began to splinter again, quietly, patiently, as if it had all the time in the world.
