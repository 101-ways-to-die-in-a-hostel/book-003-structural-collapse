# Chapter 30: The Last Door

The sound in my teeth was not thunder. It was wood, splitting somewhere behind the plaster, a slow, arterial tear that made my gums itch.

I stared at the ceiling as if I could intimidate it. The crack above my bed was no longer a line; it was a seam, a poorly stitched wound holding four centuries of weight with threadbare hope. Dust sifted down like flour, the kind my mother used to dust the counter when she made bread. In another life, I would have taken a photo and captioned it something smug about time and texture. In this life, I wiped it off my lips and tried not to cough.

The door shivered. Not the wind—something else. A push from the other side, a foot or a shoulder. The frame groaned, its wood swollen with rain, and the thin gap I'd opened earlier widened with a grudging creak.

"Emma?" A voice, faint and panicked, threaded through the crack.

I scrambled to my feet, the water slapping my calves. "Yes. Here. I'm here." My voice was too loud, too high, an instrument slightly out of tune.

"The hallway—" The voice cut off, muffled by a shout elsewhere. Another voice shouted back, something in Spanish that I didn't catch. The storm swallowed most of it, but I heard one word: "Ahora." Now.

The door moved again. The gap widened to an inch, then two. I pressed my face to it, peering through, one eye at a time. The hall was a dark, wet tunnel, lit by a flashlight beam that swung across the ceiling like a lighthouse. Plaster had fallen in a chalky pile near the stairwell. Water ran along the baseboards in a thin stream. The air smelled metallic, like rain and fear.

Carlos appeared in the beam, his face a pale oval. He looked older than he had that morning. His shirt clung to him; his hair plastered to his forehead. He saw me and his expression shifted into something between relief and dread.

"You have to come," he said. He didn't add please. There wasn't time.

"The door—" I shoved at it, trying to widen it with my shoulder. The wood resisted, soaked and stubborn. "It's stuck."

Carlos pushed from his side. The door inched open, grudgingly, making a noise like a tooth pulled from gum. The gap widened to a hand-span, enough to squeeze through if I breathed out and believed in myself.

"Go, go," he said. He glanced over his shoulder. Behind him, the hallway swayed in the flashlight beam, the ceiling sagging in places like a tired animal. The far end was darker now; I couldn't see the stairwell. I could hear rushing water somewhere below.

My body moved on instinct. I shoved my arm through, then my shoulder, my cheek scraping the edge. The wet wood burned against my skin. I would have wriggled out then, would have committed to it, if my eye hadn't caught the corner of my bed: my journal, the candle, my damp bag slumped like a drowned dog.

I stopped.

It was not logical. It was a reflex, the same part of me that made lists before a trip and wrote captions before I took photos. The journal was proof I was here. It was the story. The bag held my passport, my money, the last tangible proof of who I was outside this room.

"Emma," Carlos snapped. His voice cracked. "You can get your things later."

Later. It sounded like a gift, like a promise that time existed beyond the next few minutes. I looked at the bag, at the journal swollen from humidity, at the candle I'd set beside the paper flower like an altar. It felt absurd that in a moment of possible death I was prioritizing a notebook and a wax cylinder.

I did it anyway.

"One second," I said, and pulled back into the room.

Carlos swore, a low, sharp sound. The flashlight beam dipped as he shifted, his hand reaching through the gap. "No," he said. "No. Now."

I scooped the journal and bag in a single armful. The bag was heavier than it should have been, full of wet fabric and coins and guilt. The journal flopped open, pages stuck together. The candle rolled off the mattress and into the water. I didn't pick it up.

I turned back to the door. The gap was the same width, but the door was no longer still. It vibrated, the frame shaking with a new, more urgent tremor. Somewhere in the hallway, something heavy shifted and came down with a crash that sounded too close. The flashlight beam jerked wildly.

"Go!" Carlos shouted. His face was grim. He pulled his arm back.

I shoved myself forward, bag first. The bag caught on the edge of the frame. The journal slid out of my grip and slapped into the water. I cursed, grabbed for it, and in that second the door moved.

It didn't swing. It lurched as the building shifted, the frame twisting. The gap narrowed to a finger width. My hand was still in it. The wood pinched my knuckles. I yanked back, skin scraped, and the door settled into its swollen frame with a wet thud.

I stared at it, breathless, bag abandoned on the floor, journal floating in the water like a pale raft. The flashlight beam was gone. The hallway was black. Carlos's voice was gone. There was only the wind and the low, steady moan of old wood taking on new weight.

"Carlos?" I said, and the word sounded stupid.

The door did not answer. It did not move again. The last exit had closed itself with the indifference of a tide.

---

There is a moment after you miss a last chance where time changes texture. It becomes thick, like honey left too long in the heat. Every second drags. Every sound stretches.

I stood in the middle of the room and listened. The storm had found a new rhythm, heavier, more deliberate, as if it had decided on a script and was now following it with patience. Rain hit the shutters in pulses. The wind blew in cold sheets, a wet hand slapping the back of my neck. The building groaned in response, an old body making noises as it shifts in a chair.

I picked up the journal. The pages were wet, ink running like tears. My last few entries were blurred, the words bleeding into each other. "Authenticity" had become a smear. I wanted to laugh. I wanted to tear it apart. I set it on the mattress, where it would stay whether it was readable or not.

The hole in the wall called to me. It was bigger now from my earlier attempt, the edges softened by rain. It was the only place where the air moved freely, where the outside world still existed. The last exit had closed, but maybe this one was still open.

I put my headlamp back on and approached the opening. The balcony outside was slick, its tiles shining with water. The iron railing ran along the edge, black and wet. Below, the courtyard was a pool, the fountain a white hump in the middle. The water swirled with leaves, debris, the occasional broken chair. The courtyard walls were dark, their whitewashed surfaces streaked with rain. The broken hammock hung half submerged, a wet tongue caught in the current.

I swung a leg through the hole and lowered myself to the balcony. The plaster scraped my shin. The rain hit my face immediately, cold enough to make me gasp. The air outside smelled of salt, wet stone, and something sweet—maybe mango from a vendor's cart, because the world kept cooking and selling fruit even as my hostel fell apart.

I gripped the railing and looked down. The drop to the courtyard was not far, but the tile was underwater, and the current looked stronger than before. The rain had become a sheet. Lightning flashed, turning the courtyard into a bright, shallow sea. In that strobe I saw the stairwell to the 1920s wing—its base submerged, the first steps slick and barely visible.

I could jump. I could climb down the railing and drop into the water. I could wade across and try the stairs. I could do it. The idea was clean and sharp in my head.

Then the balcony gave a small, telling shudder under my weight.

It wasn't dramatic. It wasn't a crack or a snap. It was a subtle settling, a loose tooth in a jaw. The railing shifted a fraction in my grip. I looked down at its base. The iron was bolted into old wood that had swollen with rain. The wood was dark and soft. The bolts looked like they were set into something less solid than they should be.

I imagined leaning my weight too far, the railing giving, my body tipping into the courtyard. I imagined the fall, the water swallowing me, the current pulling me toward the broken fountain, the debris catching on my clothes. I imagined climbing out only to find the stairs blocked by rubble, the 1920s wing dark, the exit still locked. I imagined the balcony collapsing behind me, cutting off the only way back.

I realized I was balancing between two collapsing structures, one named Historia and one built to keep people from falling. There was no safe surface anymore, only choices between risks.

"You wanted authentic," I said aloud to the rain. "Here it is. Authentic drowning." My voice was snatched away by the wind.

Lightning flashed again. For a second, the courtyard was white. I saw a figure moving across the far side, a raincoat hunched against the wind. The figure carried a flashlight. The beam jittered across the water, briefly lighting the broken fountain and the wet tiles. The figure turned toward the heritage wing, toward me, but the rain was so thick that I couldn't see their face.

I opened my mouth to shout, and in that instant the wind surged, a wall of air that pushed me back against the doorframe. Rain slapped into my eyes. I tasted grit. The figure was gone, swallowed by the storm.

The balcony shuddered again, a longer, deeper tremor. I felt it in my ankles, in the railing, in my teeth. The wood beneath my feet was giving in small degrees, the way my courage was.

I climbed back through the hole, skin scraping plaster, and landed inside with a wet slap. The room smelled like damp paper and old wood. I closed my eyes for a second and pressed my forehead to the wall, which was cool and rough and solid enough to lie to me.

The building answered with a noise like a sigh.

I went back to the door. It was the only thing in the room that still looked like a door, a rectangle with an implied promise, and I couldn't stop myself from testing it. I put both hands on the wet wood and pushed. Nothing. The frame had swollen into itself, the way a cut swells shut. I slid my fingers into the narrow gap, feeling the cold air of the hallway, and tried to pry. The door did not move. It felt like the building had decided it didn't need that opening anymore.

I looked around for the bent metal rod I'd used before. It lay in the water near the bed, a useless curve. I picked it up anyway and wedged it into the gap. I leaned my weight into it, a stupid physics problem with a wet answer. The rod flexed. The wood groaned. For a second I thought it might give, and then the rod snapped with a sharp metallic crack. I jerked backward. The broken end skittered across the tiles and sank into the water.

I laughed, because that's what you do when an object breaks under the exact amount of force you thought would save you. I laughed and then stopped because the sound came out wrong, thin and papery. The hallway remained dark. The gap remained a gap. The door had won.

I pressed my ear to the wood and listened. I could hear movement on the other side—footsteps, maybe, or just water shifting in the hallway. A voice shouted, distant, the words stretched by wind. I caught nothing but the panic in the cadence. I wanted to shout back, but I didn't want to waste the oxygen on what would likely be swallowed by the storm. I said my name anyway, quietly, into the door, as if the wood might remember it and tell someone later.

In the silence after, I could hear the building itself. It had a rhythm now, a low, repetitive groan as if it were breathing. The sound rose and fell with the gusts, a patient creature taking on more weight than it was designed to bear. Somewhere deep in the structure, water moved through channels it had never been meant to find. It ran down the walls in thin lines, a slow flood, the building weeping in private.

I thought about colonialism, because of course I did. I thought about the way we love old buildings because they make us feel connected to something larger than ourselves. History, legacy, the romance of endurance. But the building had not endured; it had been patched and bribed and marketed. It had been kept standing not by love, but by money and neglect. It was a metaphor in the most literal, dangerous sense: a beautiful, decaying structure propped up for tourists until it crushed someone who wanted to feel the weight of history. That someone was me. It was almost funny, if you squinted at it from a distance.

I ran my thumb along the edge of my glasses, wiping the lenses. The scratches in the plastic caught the headlamp light, small rainbows that flickered and died. I set the glasses back on and looked at the room as if it were a passage in a book, something I could parse and annotate. Cracks: narrative tension. Water: rising stakes. Door: false escape. Beam: the obvious Chekhov's gun hanging above the bed. The problem with living inside a story is that you cannot flip the pages to see if it ends well.

The rain hammered the shutters. The wind pushed against the wall, making the plaster tremble under my palm. I felt the room tilt again, a small shift that made the water move in a smooth, unhurried wave. The bed frame creaked in sympathy. The beam above me responded with a low, irritated groan, the sound of a long bone not wanting to bear its own history any longer.

---

I returned to the bed because there was nowhere else to go and because there is a kind of logic in surrendering to the place you chose. The mattress was a sponge now. The mosquito net hung like a collapsed parachute, its mesh snagging on my hair and on the corner of my glasses. I pushed it aside and sat down, the water beneath the mattress squelching.

The headlamp's beam was dim, its circle of light no bigger than a dinner plate. It painted the ceiling in weak yellow, revealing the crack's new shape. The seam had widened into a jagged, dark mouth. The plaster around it had spidered outward, delicate veins spreading in every direction. The beam itself had changed, no longer a single line but a splintered gap with pale wood showing through.

I took out the journal and opened it to the last dry page. The paper was soft, the pen ink running. I wrote anyway, because writing was the only thing I had ever done in the face of uncertainty.

The words came out wrong. They were too dramatic, too self-aware. I crossed them out, rewrote them, crossed those out too. I was writing for an imagined reader—a future self, a friend, a faceless internet—and that audience felt obscene now, like dressing for a party in a burning house.

I wrote: "It is louder than I expected." Then, below it, "This is not romantic." Then, below that, "If you are reading this, then I am not." I stared at the line and realized I didn't believe in the conditional anymore.

The building groaned. The floor shifted. The water sloshed against the bed frame. I could feel the tilt, the way gravity was changing its mind. The bed leaned slightly toward the wall with the hole, as if it wanted to slide that way. I braced my feet against the frame, a laugh caught in my throat at the ridiculousness of it.

In the hallway, distant and muffled, voices shouted again. The sound was urgent, sharp. Then a crash, deep and heavy, followed by a burst of cursing. The building answered with a tremor that rattled the bare bulb overhead. The bulb flickered once and went out.

For a heartbeat, I was in complete darkness.

My headlamp remained, its weak circle now the only light. It felt smaller in the dark, a lighthouse in a black sea. The shadows were thicker, the ceiling closer. Dust moved slowly through the beam, tiny particles spinning like planets.

I turned the headlamp off and on again, as if it were a balky appliance and not my last tether to sight. It held, weak but steady. I kept it on. I couldn't bear the idea of the dark. I could tolerate fear. I could not tolerate not seeing it.

I thought about the waiver again, about the way I had signed with a flourish, as if my name were an autograph. Assumption of risk. Historic variability. Rustic irregularities. The phrasing was almost poetic now, in a darkly bureaucratic way. I wondered if anyone ever read those forms and meant them, if anyone ever thought, yes, I am assuming this specific risk, I am consenting to be crushed by a ceiling because it is charming. My parents would have laughed. Then they would have made me stay somewhere else.

My phone was still missing. I kept reaching for it, my hand going to the empty space in my bag, as if an absent object could be summoned by habit. I could see the Wi-Fi network in my head, the little bars, the password on a sticky note. I imagined posting a story: a shaky video of the room, the crack in the beam, the water on the floor. Caption: "Riding out the storm in a 1624 house." People would comment with shocked emojis. They would tell me to be safe. I would reply with a joke. Then I would be crushed. They would post a memorial story and write about living fully. It would be neat, complete, a narrative arc Instagram loved.

The idea made me nauseous.

I stood and moved the bed again, dragging it inch by inch away from the beam. The legs scraped, the sound obscene in the quiet. The bed moved perhaps a foot. The beam did not care. It spanned the room. There was no safe zone, only less unsafe.

My ankle caught on something in the water. I looked down and saw the candle, its wax softened and floating. I picked it up and held it for a moment, absurdly warm in my palm. I set it on the bed beside the journal, a small, pointless arrangement. I could light it. I chose not to. The smell of smoke felt too much like a warning I couldn't ignore.

Another groan, lower than before. The ceiling shifted; the crack widened; a small chunk of plaster broke free and fell onto the bed with a soft, wet thud. The dust came down in a thicker plume, and I coughed, the grit scratching my throat. I imagined it building up in my lungs, a slow filling. I forced myself to breathe through my nose, shallow and controlled.

The storm outside intensified. The shutters rattled in a faster rhythm. The wind found the hole and pushed harder, whipping the mosquito net into my face. The net wrapped around my arms as if trying to keep me here. I tore it away and threw it onto the floor. It landed in the water like a drowned ghost.

I sat back on the bed, legs drawn up, journal in my lap. I could hear the city beyond the storm, faintly. A siren, distant and wailing. A dog barking in the street. The low, rhythmic pulse of bass from a bar that had not closed, because bars never close in Cartagena and because the world is always another kind of stubborn.

I thought about my brother, about the way he would roll his eyes at my stories, the way he would secretly read my captions. I thought about my father, who would calculate the exact height of this ceiling if I told him about it, who would call a structural engineer friend and ask if it was safe. I thought about my mother, her careful warnings, her relentless check-ins, the way she ended every call with "Love you." I had always answered too quickly, as if saying it back was a chore. I said it now, into the empty room. "Love you." The words hung in the damp air, absurd and sad.

The beam made a noise like a gun cocking, a sharp little click. The sound froze me. I looked up. The crack widened by a hair, the plaster splitting further. The beam's interior looked pale, fibrous, eaten away. I could see the little tunnels where termites had once worked, a whole hidden architecture of absence. It was grotesquely beautiful, a lacework of decay.

I laughed again, a short, breathy sound. "Even the bugs had better plans than me," I said.

The headlamp flickered. I tapped it, and it steadied. I considered turning it off to save battery, but the idea of dark felt like a surrender to something I wasn't ready to admit. I left it on and watched the dust swirl in its beam.

The water rose another fraction, or maybe the floor tilted, making it feel that way. The bed frame creaked as the weight shifted. I put my hands on the mattress and felt its wet give. The room smelled of mildew and sweat and the mineral tang of old adobe. It was a smell that would have seemed quaint in daylight, romantic and rustic. Now it smelled like rot.

I could hear footsteps in the hallway again, quick and splashing. A shout. Another. Then a loud crack, followed by a crunching collapse that made the entire room shiver. The sound was close, too close. I waited for someone to call my name. No one did.

I picked up the journal and wrote one more line: "The last door closed." The ink bled. I stared at the words until they blurred.

The storm's roar deepened, a constant pressure. I knew, with a clarity that felt like a final exam, that this was the point of no return. The door was sealed. The balcony was unsafe. The building was deciding, and I had already made my choice weeks ago when I clicked "book now" on a blog that said "crumbling colonial charm." This was the charm. This was the crumble.

I lay down on the mattress, on my back, staring up at the beam. It was like lying under the hull of a ship. The crack above me seemed to widen as I watched it, the wood bowing. The plaster trembled. The beam held, holding, holding.

I placed my hand on my chest and tried to slow my breathing. I listened to the storm and to the old building's groans, the chorus of weight and water and wind. I listened for the sound that would mean it was finally over.

It came as a sharp, unmistakable snap, like a bone breaking, and I knew without moving that whatever came next would not wait for me to gather my things.
