# Chapter 21: The First Real Problem

The first thing that went wrong was not dramatic. It was my water bottle tipping over by itself.

I was lying on my back with the headlamp on, the beam fixed to the underside of the mosquito net like a moon in a trapped sky. The storm was gathering outside, an impatient animal circling the building, and I could feel the room flinch with each gust. My bottle had been on the floor by my bed. The floor was not flat. That had been charming earlier in the week, the little sense of a ship's tilt. It was less charming when the bottle rolled in slow motion across the planks and fell against my bag with a dull tap, the kind of sound that tells you the angle has changed since you last checked.

I sat up and watched it for a moment, as if physics might decide to behave if I stared hard enough. The floor had dipped another fraction. Not enough to see unless you were looking. Enough to feel in your ankles, in the small pull in your gut.

I thought: buildings breathe. I thought: this will make a good line later. I thought: I should leave, I should go back down the stairs, June will give me that look that says I am the sort of person who mistakes stubbornness for bravery. I did not move.

The storm made a low howl through the shutters, a long note that slid around the room and held. The wooden slats shivered. Somewhere above me the beam answered, a slow complaint, old wood resisting new pressure. I could almost map the sound to the crack overhead, the dark seam that kept widening by millimeters. It was like listening to a knee that refused to heal, the little pop of cartilage when the body pretended it was fine.

I rolled onto my side and listened for the quiet in the house. There was none. The common room below was a muffled hive of voices and settling bodies. Carlos's laugh was a short bark. Someone coughed. A door shut. They were all together down there, sharing the space, sharing the fear. Up here I had the whole wing, the echo of the storm, and my own head.

My phone buzzed against the mattress. A text from my mother, sent hours ago and now arriving because the Wi-Fi had briefly resumed its intermittent mercy.

Are you safe? Saw storm warnings. Please reply.

I stared at the screen and thought about the word safe, how it looked like a knitted sweater but felt like a trap. I typed, Yes, all good! and deleted it. I typed, It's fine, just rain, and deleted it. I typed, I'm okay, and left it there. It felt truer than the rest, and somehow more insulting. I hit send. The message didn't go. The little circle spun. The hostel's Wi-Fi gave me a yellow triangle of apology.

Somewhere down the hall, the old plumbing gurgled, a choking sound from a throat half full of water. The power flickered. The headlamp's beam brightened and dimmed in sympathy, as if it knew its hours were numbered.

I set my phone on my chest and let my eyes move along the ceiling. The crack was now a system of cracks, a river with tributaries. Tiny flakes of plaster clung to the beam, the way a scab clings to skin before it gives up. The mosquitos in the net were still, their tiny bodies pinned in the mesh like fossils.

The first real problem was a sound from the wall.

It was a wet sound, a slow internal slough, as if the building was shedding a layer. The wall to my right gave a soft, steady exhale. I turned my head and shone the lamp on it. The vertical gap that had already become a view to the rainy alley had widened again. I could see more of the outside now, not just the gray streak of a wall but the underside of a neighboring balcony, a wobbly line of iron. Rain slanted through the gap and struck the inside of the wall with a tapping patter. A thin line of water crept down to the baseboard and pooled.

Water inside walls was not new. Water inside the room, coming through the wall, felt different. The building was no longer keeping its skin on.

I got up and went to the wall, my bare feet instantly cold and damp. I ran a finger along the gap, felt the water. The plaster was soft, almost doughy. I pressed and it gave. A small patch crumbled under my thumb, leaving my fingerprint in the wall like a signature.

The absurd part was that my first instinct was to fix it. I pulled a shirt from my bag and tried to stuff it into the gap, like a child blocking a leak in a dam with a sock. The fabric turned dark with rainwater, heavy and useless. The gap pushed it out. It felt like trying to stop the sea with a napkin.

"Okay," I said aloud, to the room, to myself. "Okay, so. Not ideal." The word ideal floated there, ridiculous.

I grabbed my towel and tried again, folding it, pressing it into the widening crack. For a moment it held. Water slowed. The towel sagged with weight. The wall bulged around it, as if swallowing.

I took a step back and laughed, a short breath that tasted like dust. The sound died quickly, absorbed by the wet wood and old plaster.

This is the first real problem, I told myself. This is the moment where any sensible person would leave. This is where the story turns.

I had a habit of narrating myself, of placing my life on a page even as it happened. It was a defense mechanism, a way to stay a step ahead of the fear by dressing it in language. But the water in the wall didn't care about my sentences. It kept coming in, steady and indifferent.

I should have left. Instead I dragged the other bed away from the wall, the one closest to the gap. The metal frame protested with a screech, the legs scraping the slanted floor. The noise was sharp enough that I waited for someone to yell from below. No one did. The storm swallowed the sound.

I pulled my bed away too, inch by inch, until it was centered under the beam, which in hindsight was a terrible idea. It felt like something I could control. It felt like I was doing something. It felt like I was fixing it.

I took it further, because once you start pretending you have control, it's hard to stop. The beam above my bed sagged just enough to be visible in the headlamp's light, a shallow curve. I stared at it like a roof in a car park that says MAX HEIGHT 2.0M, a warning disguised as a measurement. I decided it needed support. I decided I could support it.

There was a small wooden table in the corner, the one that wobbled when you leaned your elbow on it. I dragged it under the center of the beam. The table protested with a scrape. The legs sank slightly into the softened floor, the wood damp and giving. I pushed down on it, as if I could teach it to be sturdy through force of will.

It was too low. The beam was still above it by a few inches. I scavenged the room for anything solid. My suitcase, heavy with damp clothes, went on the table. The legs flexed but held. I put my stack of books on top of the suitcase, including the dog-eared copy of One Hundred Years of Solitude that had become my Caribbean talisman. The irony of propping a collapsing colonial building with a novel about a family cursed by its own history was not lost on me. I told myself it was meta. I told myself it was funny.

Still too low. I added my shoes, the extra blanket, a towel folded into a square. The tower wobbled. I braced it with the chair. The whole assembly looked like a child's fort, flimsy and earnest.

I stepped back and tilted my head, assessing my work as if I were an engineer and not a nineteen-year-old with a headlamp and a narrative compulsion. The beam did not look more supported. The table looked less stable.

"Okay," I said. "Yes. That should... help." It was the same voice I used when my GCSE chemistry experiment didn't do what it was supposed to and I convinced myself it was fine.

The ridiculousness of it hit me and I laughed, but the laugh sounded like a cough. I was sweating. The room was humid enough that my clothes stuck to me. The air was full of dust and damp. My hands were gritty, my nails lined with plaster.

If someone had walked in then, they would have seen a precarious tower of luggage and literature under a rotting beam, a girl standing beside it with a headlamp and too much confidence. They would have told me to leave. No one walked in. The door was still shut. The building kept me to myself.

When I finished, I stood in the middle of the room, breathing fast, damp hair stuck to my forehead, and looked around. The floor still sloped. The wall still wept. The beam still had its black seam. The mosquito net still hung like a veil. The towel was a soggy tongue pushed out by the wall.

"It's fine," I told the room. "I'm fine. This is fine." The words came out in an imitation of internet irony, which is a dangerous thing to rely on when the ceiling might collapse.

The power went out.

The headlamp flickered and then steadied on its own battery. The single bulb in the room died, leaving the headlamp's beam as the only light. The hallway beyond the door fell into a deeper dark. The storm outside made a brief, strange hush, as if the wind had taken a breath. The silence was so complete that the drip from the wall sounded like footsteps.

I heard a muffled shout downstairs. A door slammed. The hostel coughed on its own darkness.

My phone screen lit with a low-battery warning. I turned it off and put it in my bag. The headlamp was my lifeline now, a little circle of light that could fail at any moment. I tightened the strap around my forehead. It felt like a bandage.

I sat on the bed and tried to breathe slowly. The room smelled more of wet adobe now, the damp turning the air sweet and rotten at once. I could taste grit on my tongue, the fine dust of the ceiling settling in my mouth. The storm's howl returned, louder, and the building answered with a low groan. Somewhere above, a piece of wood splintered. Not a crack, but a splintering, like a toothpick breaking between fingers. It was a sound too intimate for a building, too bodily.

The sound made my stomach drop. I stood up without thinking and walked to the door.

It did not open.

The frame had shifted. I pulled the handle and felt the wood resist, a swollen, reluctant firmness. I tried again, harder. The door shivered but stayed shut. The latch felt stuck, not caught on the catch but pressed tight against a frame that had moved just enough to trap it.

"No," I said, a small, sharp sound. I put my shoulder into it. The door creaked, the hinges complaining, but the edge stayed wedged. The building had tightened its jaw.

I stepped back and stared at it. The door was the same door I had pushed open ten minutes before. The door was now a problem.

This was the second real problem, I told myself. I could still fix it. I could still make it not a problem.

I grabbed the chair from the corner and wedged it under the handle, hoping to use it as leverage. I pushed down. The chair skidded on the wet floor, its legs scraping. The door didn't move. I hit it with the chair, once, twice. The sound thudded, dull and unconvincing, like knocking on a coffin.

I swallowed, throat dry. The air felt thicker now, humid and heavy, the storm pressing it into the room. I tried the handle again with both hands. It gave half a centimeter, just enough to offer me a sliver of hope, and then stuck again.

"Okay," I said. "Okay, fine." I laughed again, that absurd laugh. "So. An authentic lock-in experience. Very immersive." The humor didn't land. There was no audience. I was saying it for myself, and it was a bad joke.

I stood in the middle of the room, the headlamp beam moving with my breath. My mind raced through solutions as if this were a problem set. I could try the window. The shutters were warped and rotting. I could climb out onto the balcony ledge, maybe. The gap in the wall was wide enough to show the outside, but not enough for a person. I could call for help.

I went to the window and tried to move the shutter. It stuck. I pushed. The wood was soft, swollen with rain. The hinge squealed. The shutter opened two inches and then stopped. Water spilled in, a sudden cold splash on my arm. I closed it again, hands shaking.

My phone had no signal. I could try to shout, but the storm was a drum. The common room was below and to the other side; my voice would be a thin thread against the wind.

I stood there, heart racing, and did the thing I always do. I made it a story.

This is fine, I told myself. This is just a door. Doors stick in old buildings. The power is out, but it will come back. The storm will pass. I will sleep here, because it's safer than going into the hallway, and in the morning Carlos will pry the door open and we will laugh about it and I'll write a wry caption about doors in colonial architecture.

I believed it just enough to make it through the next five minutes.

The storm hit hard then, a full-body shove against the building. The room shuddered. Dust spilled from the ceiling in a soft shower. I held still, as if the building could sense movement and decide accordingly. The beam above me groaned, a long, unhappy noise that felt like a complaint in a language I couldn't speak.

I set the chair by the door like a guard and went back to the bed. The mattress was damp now, the mosquito net carrying tiny beads of water where the wall's leak had sprayed. The air was cooler, the wet making the heat cling to my skin in a slick layer. My hair stuck to my neck. I could smell my own sweat, sharp and sour, mixed with old wood and mildew.

I lay down and pulled the net around me. It was foolish, but it made me feel enclosed, as if I could control at least the mosquitoes if not the building itself. The net draped across my face and I pushed it away. The headlamp cast a web of shadow. The light made the dust look like a swarm of tiny insects floating in place.

I tried to read, but the words swam. I tried to sleep, but every sound snapped me awake. The storm was a steady roar with sudden peaks, the gusts hitting the shutters like a fist. The room creaked in response, the wooden joints flexing, the plaster shifting. It was not a quiet building; it was a body in pain.

I thought about the waiver I'd signed at check-in. I had barely looked at it, a paper with a lot of Spanish and a line where I scrawled my name, because it seemed like a formality, a bit of bureaucratic theater. I pictured my signature now, a loop of ink that might as well have been a confession.

I told myself I could still fix it. I could get up and pry the door. I could throw my weight at it until it gave. I could call Carlos through the wall, bang hard enough for him to hear. I could leave through the window if I had to. I could, I could, I could.

I did not.

I lay on the bed and listened to the building breathe. A crack, a groan, a shift. Each sound was a sentence I didn't want to parse. I counted them, as if quantifying the danger would make it manageable. After a while the counting blurred into the storm.

My headlamp dimmed slightly. I reached up and tapped it, a superstitious gesture. The light flickered. I swore. The idea of being in the dark made my chest tighten. It was silly, because the storm would make it dark anyway if I lost power. But I needed the light to watch the ceiling, to measure the cracks, to feel like I wasn't blind.

The drip from the wall turned into a trickle. The towel had finally surrendered, sliding from the gap in a wet heap. The water ran down the wall in a thin sheet, turning the baseboard into a shallow pool. The floor was now slick near the wall, the wood swelling further. The tilt became more pronounced. My bed, despite my efforts, had started to creep, a slow migration toward the outer wall. I could feel it in the way my body shifted without me moving, a tiny slide toward the wet.

I sat up and planted my feet on the floor, stopping the bed with my weight. I shoved it back, the metal legs leaving pale scratches in the damp wood. I was sweating from the effort. I had never moved furniture with such urgency in my life.

"This is ridiculous," I said to the room. "You are ridiculous." The room did not respond.

I glanced at the door again. It loomed, the wood swollen and stubborn. I went to it and put my palm on the surface. It felt warmer than the wall, the wood holding the building's fever.

"Open," I said softly, as if asking it politely might help. I tried the handle. Nothing.

I leaned my forehead against it for a moment and listened. Beyond, the hallway was silent or else my ears were full of the storm. I thought I heard a voice downstairs, a laughter that sounded like June's, and felt a sudden ridiculous sting of jealousy. They were together. They were sleeping. They were telling themselves a different story.

I tapped the door with my knuckles, three hard knocks. The sound felt small and pathetic. I knocked again, harder. The door did not move. There was no answering knock.

I swallowed. The air smelled of wet plaster and fear.

If I shouted, would anyone hear? Would they come? Would they even be able to open the door? The building had chosen its angle. The door was part of that choice. It was as if the house had decided it wanted to keep me.

I stepped back and sat on the bed, my heart beating too fast. I took out my notebook and wrote, because writing made me feel as if I could anchor myself to something. The pen slipped slightly; the paper was damp from the air.

I wrote: The door won't open and it feels like the house is closing its hand.

I underlined hand. I hated the melodrama of it and kept it anyway.

I tried my mother again. The message spun and failed. I stared at the screen until the battery warning reappeared and I put the phone away. There was no point wasting it. The building could have my phone when it decided, but not before.

The storm kept pressing. The shutters rattled so hard they sounded like teeth. The beam above me creaked, then something else happened, a sound like fibers tearing. I froze. The headlamp beam lit the crack and I saw a sliver of darkness widen. A line of plaster broke loose and fell in a thin ribbon, landing across the bed. The dust hit my cheek. I tasted grit.

I lay very still, listening. The building settled with a long sigh, the kind that follows a stretch of pain. The storm roared in approval.

I told myself: still fixable. Still fixable. It became a chant.

The room felt smaller now, not because it had changed, but because my attention had narrowed. Everything was a warning. The drip was a warning. The floor's slope was a warning. The door was a warning. The beam's groan was a warning. The smell was a warning. The dust in my mouth was a warning. The warnings were stacking like books on a shelf, heavy and patient.

I rolled onto my side and pulled the mosquito net around my shoulders as if it could protect me from anything. The net smelled faintly of soap and old sweat. It was a thin barrier, symbolic more than real. I could see the headlamp beam through it, the way it made the dust sparkle like tiny stars. It would be beautiful if it weren't in the middle of a room that felt like it was shedding its skin.

I tried to sleep. My body dipped with the bed's slow slide toward the wall. I got up, shoved it back, and lay down again. I laughed once, hysterical, at the idea that I was playing tug-of-war with gravity. The sound was strangled in the net.

Minutes passed. Maybe an hour. Time in a storm is elastic.

Somewhere in the building, a window shattered. The sound was a quick burst, followed by the hiss of rain entering where it shouldn't. A shout from downstairs. The hostel was not only breathing; it was bleeding.

I got up and went to the wall again. The gap was wide enough now to see the curve of the neighboring roof. The rain came in sideways. The towel on the floor was soaked and useless. The plaster around the gap was soft, crumbling under my touch. I could push my fingers into it and feel the wall give. It was like touching wet clay.

I should have been frightened. I was, in a rational way. But there was a strange calm in my hands, in the act of touching the crumbling wall. It felt like evidence. It felt like proof that I wasn't making it up, that the building really was failing. If I survived, I would have the story. If I didn't, the story would have me.

The thought landed like a stone. I shook it off.

I went back to the bed and lay down. The headlamp dimmed again. I tapped it, and it flickered back to life. The battery indicator was a sliver. I tightened the strap on my forehead until it hurt. It felt like holding my head together.

Another gust hit. The beam above me made a sound like someone snapping a thick twig. My heart went into my throat. The crack widened, not much, but enough to see a darker line. A small chunk of plaster fell onto my chest. I brushed it off with a hand that was not steady.

"Okay," I whispered. "Okay. You can do this. You can fix this." The words sounded absurd even to me. Fix what? The weather? The architecture? My decisions?

I imagined going downstairs. I imagined pushing the door open, stepping into the hallway, feeling the slope under my feet. I imagined the door refusing. I imagined calling out and no one answering. The images were all tinted with the same blue as the headlamp, the same cold light.

I was stuck between the idea of leaving and the reality of a door that wouldn't let me. That was the first real problem: not the water, not the crack, but the feeling that I was no longer in control of whether I could leave.

I sat up and took a deep breath, and then another. The air felt heavy. I could feel the weight of the building in it, the history, the damp, the long, patient pressure of wood and plaster.

"When this is over," I said aloud, because speaking made the room less empty, "I'm going to laugh about it. I'm going to drink something expensive and laugh." The dark humor was a rope I threw for myself. I held it tightly.

The storm answered with a sharper, angrier howl. The shutters slammed. The beam above me made a sound that was not a creak this time but a quick, brittle splinter. I saw it. A thin shard of wood dropped from the crack and landed on the mattress near my hip, a sliver no longer attached to the beam. The headlamp caught it and made it gleam.

I stared at the shard for a long time. It was small, almost polite. It was also a piece of the building that had come loose.

I lifted it, felt its dampness, its frayed fibers. It was lighter than it looked. It smelled of old wood and rain. It was a warning you could hold in your hand.

I put it on the table next to my notebook like a paperweight.

The storm grew louder. The wall dripped. The floor tilted. The door held firm. The headlamp dimmed. The beam above me groaned again, deeper this time, a sound that rolled through the room like thunder inside a chest.

I lay back and stared at the ceiling, at the crack that now seemed to be a mouth. I could see the dark line widening, the plaster along it trembling. My heart beat in my ears. The air tasted of dust and rain.

I told myself I could still fix it.

When the next splintering sound came, it was so close and so sharp that I flinched hard enough to hit my head on the bedframe. The beam above me shuddered. The crack ran another inch. Dust rained down in a soft, steady fall, and for a moment I couldn't tell if it was the storm outside or the ceiling inside that was coming apart.

I lay still under the drift of dust, waiting for the next sound.
