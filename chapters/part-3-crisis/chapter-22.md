# Chapter 22: The Door's Vote

The house made its choice when the door refused to open, and it chose against me.

---

I stood with my hands on the handle, feeling the small, humiliating give of the latch, the way it moved just enough to promise and then jammed again. The wood was swollen, old and damp, and the frame had shifted so the door sat pressed into it like a tooth in a socket. I could feel the building's pressure through the grain. The handle was warm from my grip. The rest of the room was cold, damp from the rain that had started to push its way in, a wet hand slipping under the shutters.

I tried once more, because the brain repeats things it thinks should work. I pulled hard, shoulders tight, and the door creaked a little in protest. It did not move. The sound of it creaking felt like the building speaking through its joints, a long, unhappy vowel.

"Okay," I said. My voice sounded too loud in the small space, swallowed by wet plaster and hanging net. "Okay, yes. Good. So we're trapped." I laughed, because if I didn't, I might have screamed.

I pressed my ear to the wood and listened for life on the other side. The storm was a constant roar, the kind of white noise that erases detail. Under it, faintly, the hostel was alive: a cough, a scrape of a chair, a door somewhere on the floor below. People were there. The house was not empty. And yet the door felt like a seam sewn shut.

I knocked. Three hard raps with my knuckles. The sound was small. I knocked again, faster, harder, the wood biting back into my skin. I could feel the vibration run through the door, through the frame, into the wall, and then it vanished into the storm. I waited for a response. None came.

I went to the wall crack again because it was the only place the outside world seemed to exist in my room. It was wider now, a soft jagged line where the plaster had given up. The gap had edges like a wound. Rain slanted through it and dampened the floorboards. The towel I'd stuffed in it lay on the floor like a drowned tongue.

I put my face close and looked out. I could see the side of the neighboring building and the lip of a balcony. The rain was so thick it made the world blurry. Below, I could see the courtyard in flashes of lightning: the fountain was half-full, the hammocks swaying, the broken tiles glistening. The courtyard light was out. It was all dark and wet and moving.

The crack was not big enough to climb through. I measured it with my eyes, did the geometry of shoulder width and ribcage, of pelvis and fear. It was a child's opening. It was a view, not an escape.

I put my fingers into the soft plaster and pulled. The wall crumbled a little, damp and clay-like. It felt wrong to destroy a 400-year-old wall, even as it was destroying itself. The chunk came away in my hand, the way a stale cake breaks. I stared at the piece of wall in my palm. It was adobe and lime, soft and gritty, and it smelled like rain and age. I let it fall to the floor.

"This is fine," I said, a joke with no audience. "Just a bit of erosion. Very on brand." I heard my own voice and winced.

The crack widened another millimeter as I watched. It was not a fast process. It was an indifferent one. The wall was giving itself away to the rain. I could almost hear it surrender.

I went back to the door and tried again. I put my shoulder into it this time, a full-body shove. The door bowed enough to creak. The frame moaned. The wood did not move. My shoulder ached. I stepped back and stared at it, feeling the first genuine pulse of fear spread through me, a quiet heat under the ribs.

I looked around the room for tools. There were none. A chair, a small table, my luggage, my books. The headlamp on my forehead cast a circle of light that made everything else disappear. It made me feel like I was in a tunnel, like the world had narrowed to wood and plaster and my own breathing.

I lifted the chair and brought it down against the door. Once. Twice. The sound was dull and unimpressive. The chair shook in my hands, the legs rattling. The door didn't even flinch. I hit it again and then stopped, because the effort was starting to feel absurd.

"Okay. Great. Lovely," I said, and then I started to laugh and couldn't stop for a few seconds. The laugh sounded thin, hysterical, and I wiped at my face and realized I was sweating.

The headlamp beam caught the beam above the bed, and I saw the curve in it more clearly than before. The crack had grown, the dark seam a little wider. Dust still fell in tiny, patient drifts. The air was gritty. I could taste plaster when I swallowed.

My phone was in my bag, useless, but I took it out anyway, as if a screen could make me feel less alone. No signal. The battery sat at eight percent and dropped to seven as I watched. I turned off the screen and put it back, a small ritual of denial.

I knelt by the wall and tried to wedge the chair into the crack to slow the water. It did nothing. The chair legs slipped on the wet floor, the gap swallowing the edge like a mouth. The storm pushed water in anyway, indifferent. The room smelled of mildew and damp wood, of old plaster giving up.

I caught myself thinking about my Instagram draft, the one I'd started earlier: a photo of the crack with the caption about authenticity and imperfection. I could see it on my feed, the line breaks, the thoughtful emoji. My face tightened. I wanted to delete it. I wanted to post it. I wanted my future self to have proof that I'd been here, that I'd made a choice, that I'd been brave or stupid or both. The Wi-Fi, in its mercy or cruelty, made the choice for me.

Another gust hit and the building shuddered. The slanted floor pulled at my ankles. Somewhere inside the wall there was a soft grinding sound, like sand shifting. The storm was not just outside; it was inside the walls, pressure moving through old joints.

I looked at the door again. It was still, its wood damp and swollen. It looked less like a door and more like a wall. I imagined Carlos on the other side, trying the handle, finding it stuck. I imagined him shrugging and walking away because he had other problems, because the building was failing in a dozen places. I imagined him calling up the stairs and my voice not reaching him.

I walked to the window and tried the shutter again. The hinge squealed, the wood swollen so tight it moved only a few inches. Rain spattered in through the gap and ran down my forearm. The air outside was loud and bright in flashes, the street drowned in water. I could just make out the edge of the balcony, the rotten wood, the iron railing beaded with rain. It was a drop to the courtyard, maybe twelve feet, maybe more. The tiles below glistened like teeth.

I closed the shutter again, my hands shaking. I had no desire to climb out onto a balcony in a tropical storm. My adventurousness had limits. The limit was wet iron and a slick wooden beam.

I went back to the bed, sat down, and breathed. My headlamp flickered, the beam thinning. I tapped it in the stupid, hopeful way you tap a flickering light. It steadied, but the beam looked weaker. The battery was dying. I told myself it was fine. I told myself a lot of things.

The storm kept breathing. The building kept answering.

---

I tried to be practical. It was a reflex, the same one that made me frame my fear as a problem to be solved. If I couldn't get out of the room, I could at least control the room. I could keep the bed away from the wall, keep the beam supported, keep the water from pooling around my things.

I moved the bed again, pulling it by the frame until my shoulders burned. The legs squealed across the damp boards, leaving pale scratches. I pushed it back toward the center, where the floor was marginally less sloped, where the wall leak would take longer to reach me. I planted my feet against the baseboard to hold it. The bed still wanted to slide, slow and persistent, a patient river.

The makeshift tower under the beam had sunk. The suitcase and books and blankets were compressing, the table legs carving into the softened floor. The whole structure looked less like support and more like a collapsing sculpture. I knelt and tried to add more height, more stability. I took my water bottle, empty now, and used it as a spacer. I wedged my sandals under the table legs to keep them from sinking. I folded my jacket and shoved it under one side. It was ridiculous. It was all I had.

I knew I was doing the wrong things in the right way. It felt like homework. I was taught to solve, to respond, to move forward, and the building was an impossible exam.

I sat back and watched the beam. My headlamp made it a pale arc, the crack a dark smile. I could see the termite damage now, or maybe I imagined it: the soft, pitted wood, the places where it didn't look solid anymore. The beam was an ancient thing holding modern weight, and I had chosen to sleep under it because it was old.

I could hear my father's voice in my head, the voice he used when explaining something to me as if I were a colleague: you don't trust old things just because they've lasted. There is such a thing as latent failure. There is such a thing as time catching up. I had rolled my eyes at that once. It felt like a sentence from his life that I didn't want to accept.

The rain came harder, the sound moving from a steady drum to a roar. The wall leak became a trickle, then a small stream, the water running down in a thin sheet. It pooled against the baseboard and spread across the floor in a shallow film. The room smelled of wet earth now, the sweet rot of adobe soaked through.

I took off my socks and folded them into the gap in the wall, a useless gesture. The wall swallowed them. The water didn't slow. I shook my head and laughed once, bitter.

"Very authentic," I said. "Very immersive. Ten out of ten."

The dark humor was a life raft. I clung to it even as it sagged under me.

I sat on the bed again and pulled my notebook onto my lap. The pages were slightly curled from the damp. I wrote because writing made me feel as if I was building a bridge to a future where I could read it. I wrote about the storm, about the door, about the way the building sounded like an animal breathing. I used words like liminal and palimpsest, because that's what I do. I underlined a phrase and then crossed it out and then underlined it again. The action made me feel like I was in control of something.

I thought about the waiver I'd signed. The paper had been damp then too, a cheap sheet with Spanish text and a line for my name. I had signed because it felt like part of the theater, part of the authenticity. I had signed because I didn't want to look like a difficult tourist. The ink of my signature was probably running now, soaked through by the humidity, a blur on a piece of paper somewhere in the reception desk drawer. I imagined it bleeding like the wall.

I stood and paced. The room was small, but pacing made me feel like I was doing something. The mosquito net brushed my headlamp as I walked, a soft whisper. The net hung like a curtain between me and the room, and sometimes I caught on it with my shoulder and had to tug it free, the mesh clinging like it wanted to keep me.

The power did not come back. The headlamp was the only light. It painted my hands pale when I lifted them, made the water on the floor shine. It also made the shadows on the ceiling look deeper, as if the cracks were wider than they were.

I heard something in the hallway. A thud, a scrape, the sound of someone moving quickly and then stopping. I went to the door and put my ear to it, heart racing.

"Hello?" I said. I didn't shout; I should have. "Carlos? Is someone there?" My voice was a breath against the wood.

No answer. I pressed my mouth to the crack between door and frame and called louder. "I'm stuck in the Historia room. The door's jammed. I need help." My words were swallowed by the storm and the door and whatever else was happening outside.

I slapped the door with my palm, then with my fist, making a rhythm, as if that would help someone recognize it as a call. I listened. There was nothing. Either no one was there, or they couldn't hear me, or they couldn't come.

The idea that there were people so close and so unreachable put a cold knot in my stomach. It was the worst part of it. I was not alone in the building, but I might as well have been.

I went back to the wall and pressed my fingers into the soft plaster. It gave. I could widen the gap if I wanted. I could, in theory, carve my way out, hand by hand, but the wall was thick and my hands were small. The idea of digging through a 400-year-old wall with my fingers was absurd. Still, I did it for a moment, just to feel like I could. The wall crumbled a bit more. The gap grew by a finger's width. The rain came in more freely.

A gecko fell from the ceiling then, or perhaps it had been displaced by the shaking. It landed on the floor with a little slap, its tail curling. It righted itself and scurried into the corner. I watched it, a small life in a collapsing room, and felt a pulse of kinship. At least it could squeeze through cracks.

I laughed again, because everything felt like a metaphor, and I was tired of being the person who saw metaphors everywhere. I was also stuck in a room with a widening wall and a door that wouldn't open. If that wasn't a metaphor, I didn't know what was.

My headlamp flickered again. I took the battery pack off and checked it, as if I could will more power into it. The tiny indicator light was red. I put it back on, tightened the strap so it hurt. The beam was slightly dimmer. I wondered how long it would last. An hour? Two? It felt like watching a candle burn down when you know you need it to read a map in the dark.

I sat on the bed and held my phone in both hands, just to feel the shape of it. I wanted to call my mother. I wanted to hear her voice say, come home. I wanted to tell her I'd been wrong. I wanted to tell her I was scared. There was no signal, no power to waste, so I didn't. Instead I pictured her asleep in Surrey, unaware, her phone on the nightstand, the screen dark. The thought made me angry and guilty at once.

The storm hit with a force that made the room sway. The beam groaned, a low, deep sound, like someone dragging a heavy chair across a wooden floor. Dust fell in a soft curtain. I closed my eyes and waited for the worst. It didn't come. The building sighed and held.

I opened my eyes and stared at the ceiling. I could almost see it bulge, a subtle shift. It might have been my imagination, the way fear distorts. It might have been real. The crack looked wider. I couldn't tell anymore.

I turned my head and saw my notebook, open on the bed. The ink on the page had bled a little from the damp, my words smudged. I thought about the story I had been writing about this gap year, the essay I would submit to Cambridge, the captions and blog posts and little proofs of authenticity. I thought about how the building was writing its own narrative with water and pressure, and how mine was a small, fragile thing compared to that.

In the quiet between gusts, I could hear the building settle, a series of tiny pops and cracks that sounded like knuckles. The house was adjusting to the storm. It was doing what old things do: accommodating, bending, creaking, until it couldn't.

---

The sound that finally got through to me was a shout, not inside the building but outside, thin and sharp in the rain. It made me lift my head, heart thudding. I went to the crack in the wall and pressed my face to it. The rain slapped my cheek. I squinted into the dark.

On the street below, a figure ran with their head down, poncho flapping. Another figure followed, a flashlight beam waving. It was too far to make out faces. It might have been neighbors checking on their houses. It might have been someone from the hostel. It might have been nobody I could call. The distance was too great.

"Help!" I shouted into the rain, my voice hoarse and small. I shouted again, louder. The wind took the sound and pushed it sideways. The figures did not look up. The storm didn't care. I pressed my forehead against the wet wall and felt my own breath fog the damp plaster.

The uselessness of it made something in me snap. I picked up the chair and slammed it against the door again, not for strategy but for relief. The chair rattled. The door shuddered but held. I hit it again. The chair leg cracked, the wood splintering. The sound echoed in the room and then died.

I threw the chair aside and stood there, breathing hard. The room was hotter, the humidity thick on my skin. My hair clung to my neck, damp with sweat and rain. My hands shook.

"Okay," I said. "Okay. New plan." I laughed, because there was no new plan. My plans had become a list of things I couldn't do.

I looked at the bed, at the narrow metal frame, and had the idea to use it as a lever. I could wedge it under the door handle, pry the door open. I could use the bed as a battering ram. The problem was that the bed was also the only thing that felt steady, the only place I could lie down. I hesitated. The door didn't care about my indecision.

I slid the mattress off, propped it against the wall. The bed frame was lighter than I expected, hollow metal with chipped paint. I dragged it across the room, the legs scraping, the frame clanging against the floor. The sound was sharp and metallic, a different noise in the wooden, damp world. I jammed one end under the door handle and pushed down on the other end, using my weight. The frame bent. The door did not move.

"Come on," I said, teeth clenched. I pushed again. The bed frame bowed, the metal whining. I imagined it snapping and taking my face with it. I stopped. The door was unmoved. I left the bed frame propped against it, a ridiculous failed lever, and stepped back.

The headlamp flickered and went dim, the beam weakening to a thin circle. I swore. The battery was almost gone. I could see the light of lightning through the crack, brief white pulses that lit the room in hard flashes. The room was now a strobe of fear: dark, then brilliant, then dark again. In the bright moments, I could see everything too clearly: the soaked floor, the sagging beam, the cracked door, the tower of luggage slumping under its own weight.

I felt the building shift under me, a long, slow tilt. The floor slanted a degree more. The bed frame, now leaning against the door, slid a few inches. I grabbed it to keep it from crashing. The wall leak increased, water pushing in faster. It was as if the storm had found a vein and was pressing into it.

In a moment of clarity that felt like panic, I dragged my suitcase away from the wall, out of the path of the water. I pulled my notebook and my passport out and put them on the bed. I was making a little island of important things in the center of a room that was becoming a shallow pool. It was a gesture. It was also all I could do.

I heard a sound from above me, a longer, deeper crack than before. I froze. The beam shuddered. Dust spilled in a line. The crack in the ceiling widened in a visible way, a dark line opening like a mouth. The hair on my arms rose. I could feel the building's weight shift, a subtle drop.

"No," I whispered. The word felt too small.

I moved away from the bed, because suddenly it felt like the last place I should be. I stood in the middle of the room, where there was no safe place, and listened. The storm howled. The building groaned. The door held.

A memory rose, irrelevant and sharp: my mother reminding me to check for smoke alarms in any room, to check the exit routes. I had rolled my eyes, because smoke alarms weren't the danger here. But exits were. I had not checked the exits. I had been too busy photographing the beams.

Another gust hit. The shutters rattled. The wall creaked. The beam made a noise like a finger snapping. The headlamp finally died, the beam shrinking and then going out completely.

For a second the room was black. Then lightning flashed through the crack, lighting the room in a harsh, blue-white flare. I could see everything frozen: my abandoned bed frame leaning like a broken crutch against the door, my luggage tower buckling under the beam, the water on the floor reflecting the light. Then darkness again.

I stood in it, breathing. My lungs felt too small, my chest tight. The darkness was thick. The storm filled it with sound. I raised my hands in front of me and could barely see them when the lightning stopped.

I thought about the headlamp's dead battery, about the way I had tapped it like a ritual. I thought about my phone, a dead weight. I thought about the storm's timeline, how long it might last. I thought about the building's patience.

I went to the bed and lay down, because there was nowhere else to go. The mosquito net draped over me, a ghostly curtain in the dark. I could feel it brush my face, damp and clammy. I tried to slow my breathing. Each inhale tasted of wet plaster and old wood. The floor slanted beneath me, pulling my body slightly toward the wall. I could feel the tilt in my bones.

Lightning flashed again, and I saw the beam bow, just for a second, the arc lower than it had been. The crack looked wider. The dark line cut across the ceiling like a seam. The sight lasted an instant, then it was gone.

In the darkness, I listened for the next sound.
