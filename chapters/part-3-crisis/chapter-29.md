# Chapter 29: The Failing Angle

The crack didn't widen. The room widened, a subtle tilt in my stomach that said the floor had decided to move before the ceiling did.

It was such a small shift, the kind of thing you would only notice if you were already obsessing over angles. I had spent the last hour watching the beam with the kind of devotion people reserve for eclipses. I knew the room's geometry intimately now: where the water pooled, where the air felt thickest, where the draft slipped in with its damp fingers. The floor slanted toward the outer wall like a question mark. Then, with a long sigh from somewhere under me, it slanted a little more.

The water slid across the tiles in a thin, lazy sheet. My socks floated for a second and then sank. I lifted one foot to test the new angle, absurdly taking it like a math problem. The toe of my sandal scraped a ridge I hadn't felt before. It was the kind of detail that would have been charming in daylight, a quaint old floor with a bit of character. At midnight in a storm, it was a verdict.

I looked up. The crack was there, pale and patient. The beam was still holding. It would hold until it didn't. The only thing that had changed was the building's posture, a slight droop that made the air feel heavier.

I moved to the wall opening and peered out, my headlamp beam cutting through the rain. The courtyard was a shallow lake now, the broken fountain a white bone in the center. The water was high enough to lap at the base of the pillars. The hammock, that limp tongue, had slipped lower and was caught in the water, a wet net clinging to the tiles.

A window in the 1920s wing glowed faintly for a moment, a flashlight bobbing past, and then it was dark again. I put my arm through the hole and waved, then realized there was no one to see me. The rain slapped my skin, a chill that made my teeth chatter. The wind smelled like wet stone and fried arepas from somewhere I couldn't see, as if the city was still cooking dinner while the hostel drowned.

I pressed my forehead to the edge of the wall and breathed. If I could get through, if I could get my shoulders past the jagged plaster, I could get onto the balcony. If I could get onto the balcony, I could climb down. If I could climb down, I could get into the courtyard and find the 1920s wing. That was the logic. It was sound. It was also a chain of ifs forged in wet, crumbling adobe.

I took off my headlamp and set it on the floor, angling it up so the beam hit the wall and not my eyes. I wanted both hands. The hole was rough, the plaster broken into teeth. I took a breath and turned sideways, shoulder first. The wall bit into me immediately, a scrape along my collarbone. I gritted my teeth and pushed.

For a terrible second I was wedged, ribs pressed to plaster, cheek against the wet edge. The rain hit my face. My arm reached through and found only air. I pushed harder. The adobe crumbled, the hole widening by a fraction. My skin burned. I felt the wall give, and then my shoulder slid through.

I was half in and half out when the wind surged. The gust hit my back, shoved me forward. The plaster scraped my hip, and I had the sudden, nauseating thought that I would get stuck here, corked in the wall like a bad joke. I froze, held still, and listened to the building creak. It didn't answer. I pulled myself forward, wriggling, inch by inch.

My head and shoulders were out. The balcony was inches below my chest, the wood slick with rain. I could feel the cold breath of the storm on my neck. I could hear the courtyard water moving in little waves. I reached down and found the iron railing. It was wet and slimy, the kind of wet that never dries. I wrapped my fingers around it and pulled, trying to lift myself the rest of the way.

Something snagged at my waist. I looked down. The edge of the wall had caught my shirt, a simple snag of fabric, but it felt like a hand. The shirt stretched. The plaster bit into my ribs. I yanked, the fabric tearing with a small, humiliating sound. For a heartbeat, I hung there, a person caught between inside and outside, between a collapsing room and a rain-soaked balcony. The wind pushed me. The wall held me. I couldn't get leverage.

I thought, with a sudden cold clarity, that this was a stupid way to die.

The decision did not feel heroic. It felt practical. I wriggled backward, pulling myself into the room. The plaster scraped my arms, the wall resisting me as if offended. My feet found the floor again, the shallow water cold around my ankles. I stood there, breathing hard, my shirt torn, my skin stinging.

I looked at the hole, at the jagged outline of my almost-escape. The opening was bigger now, at least. I'd made it that far. I could try again. I could try again with a blanket to pad the edges, with a better angle, with a rope. I had no rope. I had a mosquito net and a damp towel and a sense of my own limits.

The wind shoved rain into the room. The water level crept up by a fraction. The building gave another low groan. I backed away from the hole, half from fear, half from the instinct that staying near a collapsing wall was like leaning against a door that didn't want you.

My headlamp's beam was weak now, its circle small and uneven. I put it back on and looked up at the beam. The crack was still there, pale and long, a line drawn by time. I whispered, "Not yet," as if the beam were a skittish horse I could calm.

---

The hallway did not exist until it did.

I was by the door, pressing my ear to the wood, listening for footsteps, when the building shifted and something in the frame loosened. The door gave a tiny, wet pop. It was not an opening, not even a promise of one, but it was movement, and movement was a kind of hope. I backed up and kicked the door with my heel. The wood shuddered. A thin line of light appeared at the bottom, a hairline of hallway.

I dropped to my knees and jammed my fingers into the gap, pulling. The wood scraped my knuckles, the nails catching. The door moved another millimeter. I shoved my shoulder into it. The door resisted, then gave with a reluctant groan.

The opening was barely wide enough for a face. I turned sideways and pressed my head into the gap, the wood rubbing my cheek. The hallway beyond was dark, slick with water, and full of dust. A plaster chunk lay on the tiles like a fallen tooth. The air smelled of wet wood and something sharper, like fresh lime. There was a faint, wavering light at the far end, a flashlight moving, then stopping.

"Carlos?" I said, my voice a rasp. It felt wrong to use his name, as if I was calling a dog. "I'm here. The door—" I pushed harder and widened the gap another fraction. "I'm in Historia. The door is jammed."

The hallway swallowed my words. The storm chewed on them. A voice answered, distant and muffled, or maybe it was the wind. I couldn't tell. I put my mouth to the opening and shouted. The sound was swallowed again, the building too thick, the storm too loud.

I pressed my fingers into the gap and tried to pry. My nails bent. The door shivered but held. I looked around for leverage, my eyes finding the bent metal rod from the bed frame. I picked it up and wedged it into the gap, using it like a lever. The rod groaned. The door shuddered and opened another centimeter, enough to show me more of the hall.

The floor was tilted there too, water pooling toward the stairwell. The wall opposite had a crack that ran from baseboard to ceiling, a jagged line that looked like lightning frozen in plaster. Above it, the ceiling bulged, its paint blistered. I could see a wooden beam, not mine but its cousin, bowing under the weight. It looked bruised, a dark line where the wood had split.

A shape moved at the far end of the hall. A light swung. I saw a figure in a rain jacket, head down, moving quickly. "Wait!" I shouted. The figure stopped and turned, the light flaring toward me. For a second I saw a face: not Carlos, I thought, but maybe Ana, the Spanish traveler with the broken arm, her features blurred by rain and distance. Or maybe it was Carlos, and the storm had made a stranger out of him. The light flicked away. The figure shouted something, a short command. "Sal!" Get out. Then the light was gone, swallowed by the stairwell.

"I'm stuck," I whispered, though the person was already gone. I pressed my forehead to the door. The wood was soaked, warm from my breath. I pushed again, harder, the rod bending. The door moved a hair. The frame groaned.

Then the building made a sound like a chair being dragged across a floor. It wasn't in my room. It was somewhere in the hall, a slow, heavy slide. The light vanished completely. The hallway darkened. A soft crash followed, the sound of plaster falling and water splashing.

I froze. I imagined the figure in the rain jacket, running down the stairs as the ceiling came down behind them. I imagined Carlos grabbing someone by the arm. I imagined the hall collapsing, the stairwell blocked. The thought was so sharp it made me nauseous.

The door shuddered again, and I let go. The rod slipped, clattered to the floor. The gap narrowed a fraction as the wood settled back into its swollen frame. The hallway was a slit now, a narrow line of black. I put my fingers in the gap and felt the cold air. I could still see the crack on the opposite wall, a thin white line like a paper cut. I could see dust in the beam of my headlamp, floating in the air between me and the hall.

I shouted again, just once, a raw sound. "I'm here." The hallway did not answer.

I sat back on my heels. The water soaked my knees. My hands were shaking. The door had moved, yes. But it was still a door. The hall was still a hall. The building was still deciding. I had not, in the end, moved anywhere.

I picked up the rod and set it aside. It had bent into a useless curve. It felt like an omen. I wiped my hands on my shorts, smearing plaster into a gray streak. I could taste the dust on my lips. I licked it away, because it was there.

The ceiling creaked above me. The crack in the beam widened by a fraction. I looked up and held my breath. The beam held, as if amused by my attention, as if it knew it had all night.

---

I went back to the mattress because there was nowhere else to go and because the body, when it is tired, chooses softness over sense.

The bed was a damp raft now, but it was still the only surface that felt like a place to be. I dragged it another few inches away from the centerline of the beam, the metal legs scraping. The mattress tore more, the stuffing exposed, wet and gray. The noise of the scrape felt obscene in the quiet, like swearing in a church.

I found the mosquito net where I'd thrown it, a wet knot in the water. I shook it out. It clung to my hands, the mesh snagging on my nails. It smelled of citronella and mildew. I draped it back over the bed, a thin canopy against falling dust. It was ridiculous. It was also a habit from nights in cleaner rooms, a small ritual that made me feel like I could still choose something.

I climbed onto the mattress and sat cross-legged, the net falling around me like a curtain. The mesh caught on my glasses. I took them off and held them in my lap, wiping them on my shirt. Without them, the room softened, the edges blurring. The crack in the beam was still visible, a pale line. It looked like a mouth in a blurred face.

I reached into my bag for the phone I no longer had, a reflex like scratching an itch. My hand hit the damp nylon and the soggy notebook and the candle I refused to light. The empty space where the phone should have been felt like a missing tooth. I could picture it perfectly: wedged under the bed, face down in water, screen dark, full of messages I would never read. I imagined the WiFi signal still dutifully beaming from the courtyard, the strongest in the only spot I couldn't reach. I imagined the blue bar on my phone, the little arch of connection that meant nothing when the rest of the world was a concrete ceiling.

I pulled out the candle anyway and held it in my palm. The wax had softened in the heat and now it was slick, slightly warped. The wick was bent. I smelled it, a faint honey and smoke scent. Lighting it felt like a ceremony. I set it on the bed beside the paper flower and the damp journal, as if I were arranging a tiny altar of things that had once meant safety. I didn't strike a match. I didn't want more flame in a room full of dry beams and dry fear. I wanted light, but I wanted it without more risk, as if I could have one without the other.

My hands were shaking in that thin, constant way that told me my body had been running on adrenaline too long. I pressed my palms against the mattress, grounding myself, or trying to. The mattress squelched. The net clung to my hair. I was inside a damp cocoon of my own making.

I thought about the waiver again, folded and stuffed in my pocket. I pulled it out and smoothed it across my thigh. The ink had bled at the edges, the letters swollen and soft. Assumption of risk. Historic variability. Rustic irregularities. The language was like a polite shrug, the legal equivalent of \"good luck.\" I read the line with my name beneath it, my neat signature in a room where everything else was smearing, and I felt a sudden, ridiculous anger. It wasn't that I hadn't read it. I had. It was that I had read it like a dare.

I folded the paper and tucked it back into my pocket. The pocket was damp, the paper curled. It felt like carrying a ticket to a show I didn't want to see.

Outside, the courtyard water sloshed against the tiles, a soft, repetitive sound. The rain had a new rhythm now, slower, heavier, as if the storm was tiring. The wind still found the cracks, still whispered through the shutters. The building creaked in sympathy.

The wind pushed against the shutters. The shutters rattled back, wood against wood, a steady percussion. The rain made the room smell sweet and rotten. The headlamp's beam was weak, a tired pool on the ceiling. I told myself I should conserve it, but I couldn't bear to be in the dark. The dark was a wall of its own.

I thought about my mother again, about the way she had said, "Just be sensible, Emma." I could see her face so clearly, the little line between her eyebrows when she worried, the way she'd press her lips together to keep from sounding like a mum. I had rolled my eyes. I had called it helicopter parenting. I could taste the humiliation of that now, a bitter thing in the back of my throat.

I wondered if she was awake. It was early morning in England, maybe. She would be making coffee, checking her phone. She would see nothing. She would go to work. She would not yet know that her daughter was in a collapsing hostel in Cartagena, in a room called Historia, on a bed with a mosquito net for a ceiling.

The thought of her normal morning made my chest ache. I pressed my palm to my sternum, as if I could hold the ache in place. The beam creaked. The room answered with a slow vibration. The water shifted, a small wave washing against the bed frame.

I looked at the paper flower on the mattress beside me. It was limp now, the yellow darkened to a sickly gold. The petals clung together, their edges dissolving. The vendor had said it was for luck. It looked like a small, soggy star that had lost its will to shine.

I laughed, a short sound I didn't mean to make. It came out half sob, half cough. The net shivered with the movement. "Authentic," I said into the mesh. The word tasted like dust.

There was a new sound, lower than the creaks, a long, slow groan from deep in the building. It was the sound of something bearing weight reluctantly. It vibrated through the floor, up the bed frame, into my bones. I felt it more than I heard it. The building was settling. The building was shifting. The building was making room for itself to fall.

I got off the bed and went to the wall. The hole had widened with my earlier attempt. I could fit my shoulders through now if I were willing to scrape more skin. The balcony was slick, the iron railing gleaming with rain. The courtyard water was higher, a mirror broken by raindrops. I could see the faint outline of the fountain, a pale smudge in the dark.

I leaned out. The wind slapped my face, hard enough to make me blink. The rain was cold now, cold in that way tropical rain becomes when you are soaked through, when your body has given up on being warm. I could see the 1920s wing, the window dark, the hallway beyond it a black rectangle. A flash of lightning lit the courtyard, and for a second I saw the stairs, the tiled steps shining. The flash also showed the crack on the courtyard wall, a jagged line running down the pillar. It had been there before, I was sure. It looked deeper now.

"Help," I said, not shouting, just saying it into the rain. It was ridiculous to expect the wind to carry it anywhere. It was also a word that needed to be spoken, even if only to the night.

Another flash. The courtyard turned white, then black. In the white I saw something else: a dark smear on the wall of the stairwell, a scrawl of graffiti half washed by the rain. I couldn't read it. It looked like a word, maybe a name, blurred by water. When the light went, the wall became a rumor again.

I pulled my head back inside and closed my eyes. I could feel the wall's rough edge against my cheek. The plaster smelled damp and mineral. I wanted to sleep. I wanted to wake up. I wanted to be in a different room, a different body, a different version of myself who had chosen the safe bed.

The beam above me creaked again, a small, sharp sound. I looked up. The crack had widened just enough to show more of the beam's interior, pale and fibrous, like wet rope. The plaster around it had spidered, thin lines creeping out from the main split. It looked like a map of a place falling apart.

I stepped back, as if distance could help. The bed was beneath the beam. The net hung like a ghost. The water lapped at the legs. I thought about moving the bed again, about dragging it far to the side, about sleeping on the floor near the door. The floor was not safer. The ceiling did not care.

The headlamp dimmed again, the battery straining. The room became a penumbra. I could still see the beam's outline, but it was less clear, as if the room were a memory of itself. I touched the headlamp and whispered, "Stay." It wasn't a request for the light. It was for everything.

The building answered with another long groan. The floor shifted, a deeper tilt. The water flowed toward the wall with the hole, draining into the courtyard like a slow surrender. The bed's legs creaked as the weight shifted. The net swayed.

I found myself standing on the mattress, my knees bent, my hands spread against the ceiling as if I could hold it. My palms pressed to the plaster, cold and damp. The ceiling was solid in that moment, and for a second I believed I could hold it up. I laughed at the stupidity of the thought, and the laugh came out thin and breathy.

"It's just a building," I said. "It's just a building," as if saying it would make it less a threat. It was not just a building. It was four centuries of weight and neglect and money choices and storms and termites. It was history, and it was about to turn me into a footnote.

The beam made a sound like a long, slow tear. I took my hands off the ceiling. The crack widened, a millimeter, then another. Dust fell in a soft, steady veil. It landed on my hair, my shoulders, the net, the mattress. It tasted like old flour.

I backed off the bed and stood in the water. My heart was beating too fast, a small animal trying to escape my ribs. The room was too small for that kind of panic. I forced myself to breathe, shallowly, the way you do when you don't want to disturb a sleeping beast.

A loud crash came from somewhere below, followed by a shout. It was muffled, but it was human. The sound was followed by another, a shorter cry. I pressed my ear to the door. The hallway was a distant chaos. I could hear voices, overlapping, urgent. I couldn't make out the words, only the tone, the way people sound when they are trying to move quickly through danger.

I banged on the door with my palm, hard enough to make my hand sting. "Here!" I shouted. "I'm here!"

The voices continued. The door did not move. The beam creaked. The building did not care about my timing. It had its own schedule, its own tempo, and I was out of sync.

I slid down the door and sat in the water. The cold seeped into me. I wrapped my arms around my knees, the net brushing my face as it hung from the bed. The light from the headlamp was a weak moon on the ceiling. The crack looked like a horizon.

I thought about the word "authentic" again, how I had used it like a passport. The authentic experience, the authentic building, the authentic travel. Here it was: the authentic truth that old structures fail and young bodies break. There was no hashtag for that. There was just the room, the storm, the beam.

The wind rose. The shutters rattled. The building shuddered. I felt a shift under me, a slight movement in the floor, as if the tiles were adjusting to a new angle. The room tilted another fraction. My stomach did the same.

I stood and gripped the bed frame, using it like a railing. The water swirled around my ankles. The net draped over my shoulders, a gauze veil. The beam above me made a sound like a splintering bone.

I looked up. The crack was wider now, a dark line you could fit a finger into. The plaster around it was crumbling, the ceiling bowing. I could see the beam's guts, pale and ragged. It was no longer pretending to be whole.

The headlamp flickered. The room pulsed between light and shadow. The dust in the air spun slowly in the weak beam, a snow of history.

I closed my eyes for a second, just to rest them. In the darkness, I saw my mother's kitchen, the pale light of a winter morning, the kettle steaming. I saw my brother at the table, scrolling on his phone, not looking up. I saw myself in that scene, a ghost of a person who might or might not come home.

I opened my eyes. The beam above me had sagged a fraction more. The crack had widened again. I held my breath. The room held its breath. The storm held its breath. The building, finally, did not.

Something shifted above my head, a small, final splintering, and then the ceiling gave a groan so deep I felt it in my teeth.
