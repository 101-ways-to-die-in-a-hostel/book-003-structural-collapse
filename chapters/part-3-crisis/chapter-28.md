# Chapter 28: The Borrowed Minutes

The ceiling gave a noise like a throat clearing, and I felt my body answer it.

It was a small sound. It shouldn't have been allowed to matter. But in a room where every groan was a sentence and every drip was a clock, a little rasp in the wood meant: another minute taken, another minute owed.

I stood there in the half-light, my headlamp a tired eye, watching the beam as if I could shame it into staying whole. The crack had gone from a line to a seam. The seam had gone from a seam to a mouth. I had been here for what felt like a week and was probably an hour. Time had dissolved into water.

I told myself to move. I told myself, again, to do something. The doing was the only currency I had left.

---

The hole in the wall was my best argument. The night outside was the other side of a very damp coin. I slid my arms through the opening and tested the edge, the way you test a pool with your toe before committing. The plaster crumbled under my palms, soft and damp. The adobe behind it was darker, denser, like wet bread. I pushed and it gave, not enough to be an exit, enough to be an insult.

My hair was stuck to my neck. Rain mixed with sweat mixed with dust, and the result was the texture of old paste. I wiped my forehead with my sleeve and only made it worse. The taste of the room was a loop: plaster, mildew, salt, the metallic tang of the blood on my bitten lip. It reminded me of licking a battery, of those stupid childhood games. Everything in this room felt like a dare I had taken too far.

The balcony was still there when I peered through. The iron railing was slick, the wood saturated, the courtyard a black rectangle of water. My headlamp lit a small circle of the world and everything outside it was a rumor. The broken fountain overflowed. A hammock swung and slapped against a pillar like a wet flag. Somewhere, a palm frond scraped at stone with the sound of a hand pleading to be let in.

I leaned my head out into the rain, as if the night itself could offer advice. The wind slapped me, impatient. I coughed, a dry bark that hurt my ribs. My throat was raw from dust. I coughed again, and the sound was lost to the storm.

A flash of lightning turned the courtyard into a stark photograph. For half a second I saw two figures running, hunched, their jackets glowing white in the light. Then the darkness returned and I was alone again, just me and the hole and the weather.

"Hey!" I shouted, because it was the only word the wind might recognize. It tore it apart. I tried Spanish anyway. "Ayuda!" It was worse. My accent wrapped itself around the word like a bad sweater. The rain pulled the rest of it away.

I pressed my forehead to the wall, the cool adobe against my skin, and closed my eyes. A memory slid in the way it always does when you have nothing else to do but think. It was my mother, telling me to take the safer route. It was me, rolling my eyes and saying, "It's not that simple." She had always had the crime of being right in a way that made me feel small.

I opened my eyes. The wall was still there. The hole was still too small. The storm was still in charge.

I could try the balcony. I could try the drop. I could try the wet iron and the slick wood and a leap into a courtyard that looked like a sink. It was a bad idea. It was still an idea.

I swung one leg through the opening and felt the wet edge scrape my shin. I pulled back. The plaster left a white smear on my skin like a bad paint job. I stared at the smear, absurdly offended, then laughed once, a short, wet sound. I couldn't find it funny, but it was funny that my skin now matched the walls. Authentic in the stupidest possible sense.

The beam groaned. I froze. The laugh died. The room vibrated, a low shiver in the floorboards. My body held still, muscles tight, waiting for the ceiling to decide.

It didn't. It just sighed.

---

I sat on the mattress and pulled the mosquito net around me like a cape. It was damp and smelled like citronella and trapped sweat. I hated it. I needed it. It was the only thing in the room that didn't feel like it wanted me dead. Even the air felt heavy, a wet blanket on my lungs.

The headlamp winked again. I took it off, cradled it in my hands, and stared at it like I could will electrons into existence. The beam thinned. I did not have the energy to rummage in the bag. I did not have the courage to stop watching the ceiling for the thirty seconds it would take.

Thirty seconds, I thought. The way you think about a flight delay, or an essay deadline, or a subway door. Thirty seconds is nothing. Thirty seconds is everything when a 400-year-old beam is holding your chest hostage.

I forced myself up and crossed the room, stepping over the shallow water. It was colder now, the rain still pouring, the tile slick under my feet. I crouched by my bag and opened it with clumsy fingers. The smell that wafted up was of damp nylon and old sunscreen and the paper flower dissolving in the corner. I pulled out the pouch with spare batteries, my fingers fumbling, the net of my hair sticking to my cheeks.

Behind me the beam made a soft, sharp sound, like a knuckle cracking. I flinched so hard I dropped the batteries. They bounced in the water and rolled under the bed. I swore. I dropped to my hands and knees, my palms in the cold puddle, groping in the dark. The headlamp's beam jittered on the ceiling, watching me like a bored chaperone.

I found one battery, then another, then the third. I sat back on my heels and put them in with shaking hands, half-cursing, half-praying. The light brightened, a sudden relief. The room sharpened. The crack in the beam looked worse in high definition. It was a cruel gift.

I stood and looked up. The beam's underside had frayed into pale fibers, tiny splinters clinging like eyelashes. The crack was no longer a single split. It had branched, a small network of fractures that met and diverged like rivers. The plaster around it had spidered into thin lines, a map of a place falling apart.

"I see you," I said to it, as if acknowledgment was a kind of power.

I turned the headlamp down to save battery and sat again. The light pooled at my feet. The ceiling became a silhouette. I could hear the building like a body in a fever: the slow creak of wood, the wet slap of water, the long, exhausted sighs of a structure trying to remember what it had been built for.

I looked at the waiver again, still in my pocket, the damp paper curling. I pulled it out and smoothed it against my thigh. The ink had bled in the corners, the English words wobbling. "Assumption of risk," it said, and I thought about how easy it had been to sign away danger in exchange for a story. I had wanted to be the kind of person who chose the older room, the rougher path, the more complicated truth. Now I was the kind of person sitting in a puddle with a contract between her fingers, trying not to cry.

I wanted to write. I wanted to open my journal and make sense of this in sentences. The sentences refused to come. The room was already a story, and I did not need to turn myself into a narrator to feel it.

Instead I listened.

In the corridor, a door slammed. A voice called out, sharp and urgent. I couldn't catch the words. The sound was swallowed by the rain and the thick walls. I pressed my ear to the door. The wood was warm, damp, and unhelpful. I knocked once, a small, embarrassed tap. I knocked again, harder.

"It's me," I said, as if that would explain anything. "I'm still here."

The hallway answered with silence. The only response was the building's low groan, a vibration under my palm.

I pulled back and slid down the door, my back against it, my knees drawn up. The water seeped into my shorts. I shivered. The shiver made the headlamp beam wobble. The beam wavered on the ceiling, and the crack looked like it was moving, like it was breathing with me.

In my head, a voice said, You could still go. You could still try the balcony. You could still be stupid in a different way. Another voice, quieter, said, It isn't about courage. It's about physics. I hated both voices for being right.

---

The first real collapse happened without warning, which is how everything seems to happen when you are too tired to be surprised.

It wasn't my room. It was somewhere down the hall, a sharp crash and a shower of dust that made my lamp's beam flicker. The floor jolted under me like a wave. I felt it in my teeth. I heard someone scream, a short, high sound, then the storm swallowed it and the silence returned like a curtain.

I was on my feet before I knew I was moving, hands on the door, shoulder pressed. I shoved. The door didn't budge. The frame had swollen into itself, bloated by rain and time. The door was no longer a door; it was a sealed seam. I pushed harder, the muscles in my arms shaking. The door gave a millimeter, maybe. It might have been my imagination.

"Open," I said, as if I could order wood. It didn't.

The crash had changed something. The room felt smaller, the air thicker. It wasn't just fear, though fear was part of it. It was the knowledge that the building had started to give in places. It was not just threatening anymore. It was acting.

I walked back to the hole and looked out. The courtyard was a sheet of black water, punctured by rain. The broken fountain was a white shape in the dark. The hammock had torn and hung limp, a wet tongue. I saw no movement.

I shouted again, voice raw. "Is anyone there?" The words felt childish, like calling for a parent in a supermarket aisle. The rain did not answer.

I climbed onto the bed frame to get higher, ignoring the wobble of the metal legs. The headlamp's beam swept the balcony. The railing glistened. The drop beyond it seemed deeper now. My stomach rolled. I could not tell if I was higher or just more afraid.

Lightning flashed. For a split second I saw the corridor through the open door of the opposite room, the one called Colonial. It was dark inside. A piece of plaster hung like a torn curtain. Then the light went out again and the corridor was gone.

A second later, a new sound: a slow grind, like something heavy sliding. The building was shifting. I put my hand on the wall to steady myself. The wall felt wet and soft. I could feel it trembling beneath my palm. I felt, in the most animal way, that I should get off the bed, that the floor was safer. But the floor was water and the ceiling was above the bed. There was no safe place in a room that was failing. There were only worse places.

I stepped down and sat on the mattress. I wrapped my arms around myself. My teeth chattered. I hated that my body was reacting like this, that it was doing its small mammal thing, its shiver and hunch. I wanted to be a mind. I was a body. The building was reminding me of that in ways no philosophy class ever could.

The sound of the rain softened for a moment, as if the storm were catching its breath. In the lull, I heard another noise: a distant bell, muffled by wind. It was the church in the old city, stubbornly marking time even while the roof of a hostel buckled. The sound made me feel absurdly comforted. It was proof that the city was still there, that the world had not narrowed entirely to my room. It was also proof that time was passing whether or not I wanted it to.

I found the paper flower again, a limp yellow mess. I set it on the mattress beside me. It left a damp stain on the sheet. I stared at it and thought, For luck. It made me laugh in the same way you laugh when you miss your train and you are too tired to be angry.

---

Time went strange. The room was a tide. The storm rose and fell. The beam above me creaked and then fell quiet, then creaked again. Every time I tried to convince myself it had stabilized, it reminded me it hadn't.

I tried to distract myself with inventory. It was what I did when I was anxious in exams: list the facts, take control of the small pieces. Facts: I had water. I had a headlamp with fresh batteries. I had a door that would not open. I had a wall with a hole in it. I had no phone. I had no one with me. I had a ceiling that was trying to become a floor.

I tried to sleep. I closed my eyes and counted to thirty. At twenty-three, a creak jolted me upright. I told myself, You cannot stay awake forever. I told myself, If you fall asleep, you will die. Both were true. I hated them.

I thought about my feed. I thought about the last post I'd made, the photo of the beam with the caption about stories. It was a good photo. The light had been golden. The comments had been the right kind of impressed. I imagined those comments now, a chorus of well-meaning friends telling me to be safe, as if the internet could do anything but look.

I imagined someone from home seeing the news later, the headline with the word "collapse" and the name of the hostel. I imagined my face under it, the picture from that post, my head turned to the beam like I was listening. The irony made me feel sick. It made me angry in a way that had nowhere to go.

The building creaked. The crack widened a fraction. I sat up, my headlamp beam trained on the wood. The crack was now wide enough to see deeper into the beam's belly, the paler interior exposed. I could see the termite tunnels, a network of tiny hollow lines. It looked like a map of something eaten. The beam was a husk. It had been pretending for years. The storm was simply calling its bluff.

I whispered, "Okay," because there is something calming in saying a word that does not solve anything.

I listened for voices again. None. I listened for footsteps. None. The hostel beyond my door was either empty or too busy surviving to remember me. I could not blame them. I could only wish, with a tired sort of grace, that they were okay.

Another crash, closer this time. The room shook. A strip of plaster fell from the ceiling and landed on the bed with a wet slap. I flinched. The plaster left a white smear on the mosquito net. I picked it up. It crumbled in my fingers, soft as cake. My hands were shaking now, a tremor I couldn't control. The room was taking, in small, steady bites.

I stood and moved the mattress again, dragging it through the water, the metal legs screeching. The sound made my teeth ache. The mattress tore further at the corner. The stuffing peeked out like a wound. It was pointless. It was also the only thing that felt like a decision. I moved it away from the centerline of the beam again, even though the beam didn't care about my geometry. It would fall where it would fall.

I put my hand on the wall and felt it pulse with the wind. The rain had softened it to a sponge. I pressed harder and felt the adobe crumble. I tore at it with my fingers, nails scraping, the grit digging under my cuticles. The hole widened another inch. The rain came in faster. The wind carried a sweet, rotten smell from the courtyard. It was the smell of wet flowers, of decay, of the city itself.

My hands bled a little. The blood mixed with the plaster into a pink paste. I wiped it on my shorts. I did not have the energy to care about stains.

---

At some point, the storm changed pitch. It wasn't just louder. It was deeper, as if the wind had moved from whistling to moaning. The shutters rattled in their frames. The door vibrated under my back. The whole room felt like it was being shaken by a slow, impatient hand.

The beam answered with a long, drawn-out crack. It wasn't loud. It was long. It was the sound of something very old finally admitting its age.

The crack split along the grain and then stopped. I could see it in the headlamp's beam: a thin white line that lengthened like a slow scratch. I held my breath. I waited for the drop. It didn't come. The beam held, but it had given another piece of itself away.

I felt a strange rush of gratitude. I hated that I felt it. Thank you, I thought, and then, for what? For one more minute? For one more breath? The building was not a person. It was a fact. I was thanking a fact.

I tried the door again, on instinct. The knob was cold and wet. The door did not move. I kicked it once, not in anger but in a test. The sound hurt my foot. The door did not move. It was a wall now. It might as well have been the outside of a tomb.

I pressed my ear to it and heard, faintly, something like a voice. It could have been the wind. It could have been someone calling. I held still, my heartbeat thudding in my throat. The sound came again, clearer this time, a man's voice. Spanish, urgent. I couldn't make out words. I put my mouth to the door and shouted, "I'm here!" The word came out as a cracked rasp. I waited. There was no reply. If they heard me, they did not answer. If they did not hear me, then I was speaking to a piece of wood and wasting my breath.

I slid down the door and covered my face with my hands. My palms were gritty. I tasted dust. I thought about the way I had told myself I was brave. I thought about the way I had told myself I was not like other tourists. I thought about the way I had told myself I could handle things. It all felt like a private joke I had told too loudly.

The room shifted. It was subtle, a tilt that made the water creep toward the wall. The floor was already slanted, but this was new. I felt the angle in my stomach. The building was changing shape. It was a slow transformation, a very old body making a decision.

I stood and put my hand on the beam again, the rough wood against my palm. It vibrated with each gust. I imagined the termites inside it, their tiny mandibles clicking, their slow work now revealed. I imagined the beam as a hollow bone, brittle and tired. I imagined the weight of the roof pressing down, the wind pushing sideways, the rain softening the walls. I imagined all of it as a math problem and knew the answer was not in my favor.

I took the mosquito net off the bed. It tangled in my fingers. I threw it to the side. It landed in the water with a wet sigh. I did not want to be caught in it if the ceiling came down. The net was a joke now, a thin mesh against a beam.

I sat on the floor instead of the mattress, my back against the wall, and let the cold seep in. The water was ankle-deep, then a little higher. The room was filling slowly, not enough to drown me, enough to make everything heavy. My clothes clung to my skin. My hair was a wet rope down my back. My glasses were fogged, and I took them off, wiping them on my shirt, then putting them back on because without them the room blurred and I needed sharpness. I needed to see the crack in all its ugly detail.

The headlamp was too bright now. I turned it to the wall, a small mercy. The ceiling went dark. I could feel it above me, even when I couldn't see it. That was worse. I turned the light back up. I wanted to watch the thing that might kill me. It felt like fairness.

---

A new sound joined the room. It was not the beam. It was not the rain. It was a low, rhythmic thud, somewhere below, like someone dragging furniture or trying to push a door. It came and went. It could have been Carlos. It could have been a guest. It could have been the building itself rearranging its bones.

"Hello?" I called, and then I didn't, because it felt pathetic. I swallowed the word instead. I had been loud enough tonight. I had been loud enough to make my own shame echo.

The thud stopped. The silence that followed was enormous.

I looked at the hole again and, without thinking, stuck my arm through. The rain slapped my skin. The wind pulled at my sleeve. I reached out as far as I could, fingers searching for the balcony edge. My fingertips brushed wood. It was slick, slippery, and too far to grasp. I stretched further, the plaster scraping my shoulder. The wall bit into me. I could have pushed through with more force, but the idea of being stuck halfway, wedged in the wall like a cork, made my stomach turn. I withdrew my arm, skin raw, and sat back on my heels.

The room hummed with tension. It felt like the air itself was taut, a thread waiting to snap. I had the sense that something was about to happen, not because I had evidence, but because the body knows when it's on the edge of a cliff even before the ground crumbles.

The beam made a sound like paper tearing. A thin line of dust fell, steady as rain, from the crack. I watched it, hypnotized. The dust was fine and light, drifting, catching in the headlamp's beam like moths. It landed on my hands. It landed on my lips. It tasted of old wood and time.

I coughed. The cough hurt my ribs. I thought about the ways you can die in a hostel: food poisoning, a fall, a stabbing, a bus crash. A collapsing ceiling was not exotic. It was just physics. It was just the consequence of years of neglect and the wrong kind of weather at the wrong time. There was nothing romantic about it. That was, perversely, the worst part.

I found myself laughing again, soft and involuntary. It was the laugh of someone who had no other punctuation. "Authentic," I whispered, and the word sounded like an insult.

The building answered with another long, low creak. The beam sagged by a fraction of an inch. I could see it. I could see the way the crack widened, the way the ceiling bowed. It was small. It was enormous.

I stood, because I did not want to be sitting if it fell. I did not know why that mattered. I told myself it was about being ready to move, to roll, to protect my head. I told myself I could do something. I told myself a lot of things.

The headlamp's beam trembled on the ceiling. The room vibrated. The storm outside roared, a sound like the sea at night. The rain struck the shutters in waves. The beam above me shivered.

Somewhere below, a voice shouted again, louder, more urgent. I heard the word "sal" - get out. It sliced through the storm. It was not for me. It could not be for me. The door did not open. The wall did not widen. The building did not care.

I backed toward the door, my hands out, as if I could brace it with my body. The wood was warm against my back. The floor was cold under my feet. I felt very small between the ceiling and the water.

Then the beam made a sound that was different from all the others.

It was a crack that cut through the rain. It was sharp, clean, and final-sounding. The room shook. Dust fell in a thick sheet, blotting the headlamp's beam. I coughed and blinked, my eyes stinging. Through the dust, I saw the crack open wider, the beam splitting along its length like a seam being pulled apart.

I froze, breath held. The beam held too, for a terrible, trembling second. The room stood on a knife edge, both of us holding.

And then the crack kept growing, slow and sure, as if the wood had all the time in the world to decide.
