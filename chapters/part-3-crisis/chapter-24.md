# Chapter 24: The Weight of Air

The beam above my head made the sound of a tree deciding it no longer wanted to be a tree.

It was a long, tearing groan that started in the middle of the ceiling and slid into my bones, a noise you feel in your teeth before you understand it in your mind. It took a second to register and in that second I did nothing, because sometimes your body pretends that if it stays still the thing will change its mind.

Then lightning tore the room open and I saw the beam shudder. It didn't break. Not yet. It held itself up with the strained, offended posture of something old and proud. The crack above it widened, a dark mouth opening another centimeter, and plaster loosened in a thin ribbon that drifted down like ash.

I rolled off the bed and onto the wet floor, because the bed felt like a bullseye. The water was cold, an unpleasant slap. I crouched with my back against the wall, not the leaking one but the interior, the one that led to the hallway I couldn't reach. I pressed my shoulder into the wood as if I could borrow its steadiness.

I listened. The building settled into a low, continuous moan. The rain hammered. The walls breathed. Nothing else fell. My heart beat too hard and too fast and my breath sounded like a stranger in the dark.

This is still not the collapse, I told myself. This is just the building complaining. Old houses complain all the time. I knew this was a lie, but the mind is a generous liar when it needs to be.

I stood up and put my hands on the bed frame. The bed had crept again toward the wall, its legs sliding slowly through the water as if pulled by an unseen current. I shoved it back toward the center of the room and felt the metal bite into my palms. It moved a few inches and then refused. The floor wanted it by the wall. The room wanted it under the beam. The house had preferences.

"Not tonight," I said to the bed, to the house, to the beam. My voice was hoarse, the words damp in the air. No one answered. I had the distinct feeling that I had already lost the vote.

The storm shifted, another gust pressing against the shutters. The wooden slats rattled like teeth. The rain came in sideways through the gap in the wall, the water now a steady sheet that ran down to the floor and spread like a shallow lake. The smell of wet adobe thickened. It was earthy and sweet and decaying, the smell of old clay giving in.

I went to the gap and put my face close, let the rain slap my cheek. The alley outside was a smear of gray and moving water. The balcony opposite shivered in the wind. I could see the courtyard below in flashes, the fountain brimming, the hammocks whipping. The hostel's courtyard tiles looked like scales under the rain.

I shouted again. "Help!" My voice was not a scream, more like a rasp, because some stubborn part of me still wanted to sound composed, as if composition mattered more than oxygen. The wind took it, the rain ate it. No one looked up.

I went back to the door and put my hand on the handle. It didn't move. The bed frame, still wedged under the handle like a failed lever, had bent further, the metal bowed from my earlier attempts. I pushed down on it once more out of stubbornness, out of ritual. The door didn't budge. The frame groaned. I let go.

I stood in the middle of the room, soaked from hair to hem, and tried to make a plan. Plans require options. I had three: the door, the wall crack, the window. The door was a joke, the wall crack a mouth too small, the window a leap into a courtyard of slick tiles in hurricane rain. None of these were plans. They were paragraphs without verbs.

I thought about the waiver again, about the fine print I hadn't read. I thought about the word "rustic" in the booking description, and how I had liked it because it promised authenticity. I thought about how I had told June, casually, that I wanted the older wing because I wanted the real thing. I had gotten it. The real thing was wet and groaning and wedging itself around me.

Lightning flashed, closer now, and in the blue-white snap I saw my tower of luggage and books collapsing under the beam. The table legs had sunk into the softened floor until the tabletop was at a slant. My suitcase leaned against it, my books now a soggy stack that looked less like support and more like an offering. I could see the cover of One Hundred Years of Solitude warped by damp. It was a stupid, beautiful image, literature literally crushed by history. The irony was so sharp it almost made me laugh.

I didn't laugh. I had no breath to waste.

The storm went quieter for a moment, the wind dropping, the rain shifting from a roar to a dense, steady fall. The sudden reduction in noise made the building's sounds loud: the pop of plaster, the groan of wood, the wet shiver of the wall. It sounded like a giant animal settling into an uncomfortable sleep.

I sat on the bed because my legs were shaking. The mattress was damp, the sheets cold. My notebook lay open, the ink smeared by humidity. I traced one of my sentences with my finger, the words bleeding together: The door won't open and it feels like the house is closing its hand. I had underlined hand. In the dim flashes of lightning it looked like I had been trying to warn myself all along.

A memory surfaced, uninvited: my mother at the kitchen table, a cup of tea in her hand, saying, "Please don't be stupid for the sake of a story." I had rolled my eyes. She had sighed in that way she did when she knew I was going to do it anyway. I had promised to be safe. I had promised a lot of things that night. It felt obscene now, the way promises can be so light until the weight arrives.

I wanted to call her. I wanted to tell her that I was sorry and that I finally understood why she had been scared. My phone was a dead slab. I picked it up and held it anyway. It felt like a relic of a life where I could send texts and think that meant I was connected to people. Now it was just a smooth rectangle, a bit of plastic and glass, silent as the door.

I set it down and listened to my own breathing. The air felt thick. It wasn't actually thinner, but the humidity and the dust made it feel heavy, as if each inhale had to be coaxed. The room smelled of wet wood and mildew and the faint metallic scent of my own sweat. The taste in my mouth was grit and cold tea.

I stood again, because sitting felt like giving up. I paced the room in small loops, four steps to the wall, four back to the bed. The mosquito net, still in a heap, caught on my ankle. I cursed and kicked it aside. I was not going to let myself be tangled when the ceiling decided to come down. That felt like a line I could draw.

Lightning flickered, then thunder rolled in a long, exhausted growl. In the brief light I saw the beam again. It looked lower. It probably was. The crack looked wider. The plaster surrounding it had spiderwebbed into a fine network of fissures, each one a decision that had already been made.

I had the thought, terrible and calm: this room is going to fall apart while I am in it. The thought didn't arrive as panic. It arrived as the kind of certainty you get when you watch a glass tilt too far on a table. It was only a matter of time. The table might wobble, but gravity would not.

I pressed my palm against the wall, as if feeling for a pulse. The wall was damp and soft. The paint came away on my skin. I slid my fingers into the crack and widened it a little, just because I could, because doing something was better than doing nothing. The wall crumbled. The crack got bigger. The rain came in faster. I stopped. I had made the problem worse in the name of action. It felt like a summary of my life.

I put my hands on my knees and breathed. The storm eased for a second, a lull, and then the wind came back with a force that made the shutters slam. The door shivered. The beam above me made another low, tearing sound. I flinched. I heard something else too, a faint voice from below, the sound of someone shouting in the common room. The words were swallowed by the walls, but the tone was panicked.

Someone downstairs knew the building was failing. Someone downstairs was yelling. The thought brought a brief flicker of relief. I was not the only one. The relief evaporated just as quickly, because if they knew, and still no one was opening my door, then I was still stuck.

I went to the door and put my mouth to the crack. I shouted again, louder this time, the word sharp in my throat. "I'm in Historia. The door is jammed. I can't get out." The sound felt raw and unfiltered. I heard my own desperation. It tasted like metal.

No answer. The storm moved my words away like a hand brushing crumbs off a table.

I slid down the door and sat with my back against it, knees up, arms wrapped around them. The door was warm from my skin. The wood smelled of rain and old polish. I could hear the building's heartbeat in the grain. It felt absurdly intimate, like being stuck against a ribcage.

A gust pressed hard against the building, and the room shifted again. The floor slanted a degree more. The bed crept, slow and inevitable, toward the wall. The water pooled deeper, catching my calves. I moved my feet and felt the water ripple. It was cold. It was patient.

In the next lightning flash I saw the beam flex. It dipped and then settled. The crack widened a little more. The plaster that had been holding on by habit gave up and fell in a thin cascade. The dust made me cough. The dust tasted old, a fine grit of history and rot.

I stood up, coughing, and moved the bed again, pushing it with my shoulder. It slid an inch and then stuck. The room was a slow river and everything inside it was debris. I was debris too, only I was trying to argue with the current.

"Fine," I said. "Fine, then." I dragged the mattress off the bed frame and put it on the floor by the door, away from the beam. If the ceiling fell, I wanted distance. The mattress was damp and heavy. I wrestled it into place and then lay on it for a moment, chest heaving, hair wet against my neck. The floor was cold under the thin padding, but it felt safer than the metal frame under the crack.

It did not feel safe. It felt less stupid.

I lay there listening to the storm and the building. The rain had changed again, falling in a steady sheet. The wind came in pulses, like the ocean breathing. The building creaked in response, a long, steady lament. It was the sound of a thing doing its best and failing.

My thoughts began to wander, as if my brain, starved of external options, had decided to entertain itself. I thought about Cambridge, about the reading lists I'd already started, about the way I would sit in a lecture hall with my notebook and try to sound smart. I thought about how I'd imagined this gap year as a series of chapters, each one a story to tell later. I had not imagined this chapter. This chapter was not for telling. It was for surviving.

I imagined writing about this later anyway, because that's what I do. The idea of it felt grotesque, a sentence with too much aesthetic and not enough apology. I decided, then, that if I got out, I would not post it. I would not make it into a story. I would just go home and make tea and let the quiet be enough. That promise felt new. It felt sincere. It also felt like bargaining, the kind you make when the building is deciding whether to let you live.

The beam above me made a fresh crack, sharper and closer. I sat up, heart thudding. Another crack followed, then another, a quick series like knuckles popping. The sound was directly above the bed frame, the place I had been lying minutes before. I was glad I had moved. I was also aware that the ceiling did not care which part of the room I chose. It was above all of it.

Lightning flashed and I saw a new line in the beam, a thin pale fissure. It looked like a vein. The crack in the ceiling had spread across, its fingers reaching. The beam sagged a fraction. It was not a collapse, but it was a surrender.

I stood and backed into the door again, because that felt like the only solid thing. The door did not open. The irony of taking comfort in the thing that trapped me was not lost on me. It was the kind of irony that makes you want to laugh and cry at the same time. I did neither. I saved my breath.

The sound of water changed. It was no longer a trickle; it was a steady pour. The wall crack must have widened. I could hear the rain hitting the floor in a louder rhythm. The room was now a shallow pool, the water sliding across the slanted boards in slow waves. The smell of wet adobe was overwhelming. It was as if the walls were melting.

I got up and looked at the crack. In the next flash of lightning I could see more of the outside, the gap widened by my earlier clawing and by the pressure of the storm. The plaster around it was ragged, the edges soft. I could see the black underside of the neighboring balcony, the railing gleaming with water. The gap was still too small for me, but it was larger than it had been. I put my head to it and felt the wind. It was warm and wet, Caribbean air heavy with rain. For a second I let myself imagine squeezing through, dropping down to the courtyard, running barefoot through the water. Then lightning showed me the slick tiles and the distance and the lack of cover, and the imagination died.

I turned away and put my forehead against the door, closed my eyes. The wood was cool. I could feel my own breath on it, a small warm patch in a cold room. I pressed my palms flat and pushed, just to feel like I was doing something. The door did not move. It had made its decision.

I thought about the people downstairs, the common room full of wet backpacks and damp clothes, the smell of instant coffee and wet shoes. They would be together, sharing light, sharing stories, checking each other's phones. I was up here in a dark wing with a door that would not open. The separation felt enormous, like a border. I had wanted authenticity. I had gotten solitude.

There was another sound then, from below, a long grinding creak. It was the sound of something large shifting, wood on wood. It made the hairs on my arms rise. The building was moving. Not just the wing. The building. It was adjusting to water and wind and age, and I was inside it like a flea inside a ribcage.

The wind surged, a full-body shove, and the room lurched. I stumbled. My hand went out and caught the bed frame, slick with damp. The bed frame slid half an inch and I felt the floor tilt. The beam above groaned in response. The crack widened. Dust fell. I tasted it again, chalky and old.

I coughed, then laughed, a short, involuntary bark. It was ridiculous, the way I kept tasting history. I had wanted to sleep in it, to breathe it in. Now I was literally eating it. I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand and the grit came away in a gray smear.

The storm eased again, a long breath. In the quiet between gusts I could hear the drip, drip, drip of water from the ceiling. It was not just the wall anymore; the roof was leaking too. The water fell in a steady rhythm onto the bed frame, a soft pat like fingers. The bed frame shivered. The sound was almost gentle, which made it worse.

I stood in the middle of the room and looked up. In the dim light from distant lightning I could see the ceiling bowing. It was subtle, the curve of an old thing under too much weight, but it was there. The crack in the center was a dark line, the spiderwebs around it like veins. I had the absurd thought that the ceiling was a skin and the beam was a bone, and both were failing.

I thought about my father again, about how he had explained load-bearing structures when we built a treehouse in our garden years ago. "The load is the weight the structure carries," he had said, showing me how the beam took the pressure. "If you overload it, it doesn't tell you in time. It just goes." I had nodded, bored. I had been twelve and more interested in the idea of sleeping in a treehouse than the physics of it. I could feel twelve-year-old me now, and I wanted to tell her to take the physics seriously.

Another lightning flash, then a thunderclap so close it made my ears ring. The beam shuddered. A chunk of plaster fell, larger this time, striking the bed frame with a thud. The sound made me jump. The chunk lay there, white and wet, like a piece of bone. The ceiling was shedding. The air was full of dust and damp. I could feel it in my lungs.

I moved the mattress again, further from the bed frame, as far as the room would allow. The room was not big. There was nowhere to go that wasn't under something. I ended up in a corner near the door, curled on the damp mattress, my back against the wood. I pulled my knees up and wrapped my arms around them. I listened to the building breathe. I tried to make my own breath match it, slow and steady.

My thoughts began to float. It was the effect of exhaustion, or the air, or the way fear can make your mind slippery. I thought about the Australian surfer I'd kissed in Mexico and how I'd told my friends it was romantic. It was mostly awkward. I thought about my brother texting me a meme earlier in the week, and how I hadn't replied because I wanted him to think I was busy being interesting. I thought about my mother and her quiet voice. I thought about the last thing I'd eaten, a soggy arepa from the street corner, and how it had tasted of salt and oil and comfort.

The absurdity of remembering an arepa in this moment made me laugh again, softly. The laugh came out like a cough. The air was heavy. My chest felt tight, not from weight but from anxiety. I took a deep breath and felt the dampness slide into my lungs. It felt like breathing through a warm towel.

I told myself to stay awake. I told myself to listen. If the beam went, I wanted to know. I wanted to move, even if movement wouldn't help. I wanted to feel like I had done something, even if the doing was just a gesture.

The storm kept time. The rain kept falling. The building kept shifting. The door stayed shut.

At some point the wind changed direction, pushing from the other side. The shutters rattled differently. The wall crack shivered. The door groaned as the frame adjusted. The sound was long and low. The room felt like it was settling into a new angle, a subtle change that made the water on the floor move. The mattress beneath me shifted. I grabbed the edge and pulled it back. It did not want to move.

I heard footsteps then. Not the random scuffle of the building, but the thud of a human foot, two of them, moving quickly in the hallway below. A voice called out, blurred by the rain and the walls. It could have been Carlos. It could have been June. It could have been a stranger. It was a voice, a human sound, and I sat up so fast the room tilted.

"I'm up here," I shouted. "Historia. The door's jammed." The words came out too neat, as if I were ordering coffee. I yelled again, louder, letting the desperation show. "I'm stuck. I'm stuck!"

The footsteps stopped. Silence stretched. I waited, breath held, for the sound of someone coming up the stairs, for the scrape of a key in the lock, for any sign that I had been heard. Nothing. The rain filled the gap. The building sighed. The footsteps resumed and faded away. I felt the sound of them in my stomach, a hollow drop.

I pressed my ear to the door and listened until my neck cramped. There was nothing. The door remained a wall. The hallway remained a rumor. The house kept me where it wanted me.

I turned to the wall crack and stared at it. It seemed bigger in the dark, a jagged smile letting in the weather. The rain blew in and out as the wind changed, a wet breath. I put my head through it as far as I could, feeling the plaster scrape my hair, and looked down. The courtyard was a shallow sea. The fountain overflowed. A hammock had torn loose and was slapping against a pillar. The tiles shone with rain, each one slick. It was not a place to land. It was a place to break.

I imagined myself climbing out anyway, hands on the wet adobe, feet searching for a hold, the wind catching my shirt like a sail. I imagined slipping, my body turning, the fall short but violent. I imagined the headline: British student falls while trying to escape storm. The dark humor of it hit me, the way every possible ending seemed to be an ironic lesson in risk. I laughed, one short, bitter sound, and the laugh turned into a cough.

My throat was raw. My lips tasted of salt and grit. I wiped my mouth and saw dust on my fingers. The house was shedding into me. It felt less like I was inside a building and more like I was being digested by it.

I thought about the hostel's name, Casa Colonial Los Muertos. The guidebook had said it meant House of the Dead, which I had found melodramatic and charming. Now it felt like the oldest joke in the world, the kind no one enjoys when it finally lands. I had chosen a room in the House of the Dead and paid extra for the privilege. If I survived, I would never be able to be that brand of smug again. If I didn't, well, the building would keep the joke to itself.

I tried to pray again, because the situation felt like one where prayer is appropriate. It came out as a list, a frantic inventory of things I would do differently: I would go home. I would say sorry. I would stop pretending that danger made me interesting. I would let my mother be right. I would let my father be right. I would let my brother call me extra without fighting him. I would read the waiver. I would listen to Carlos. I would be ordinary and alive. The list became a mantra. It did not change the sound of the beam.

The air felt heavier. I realized I had been breathing shallowly, as if conserving oxygen would matter if the ceiling came down. I forced myself to take a deeper breath and felt the dampness press into my lungs, a warm, sour weight. The air smelled of wet wood and old plaster and my own sweat. It felt like breathing through a thick cloth. I thought about how many hours the storm had been going and how long the building could keep breathing like this.

Another memory surfaced, a stupid one: a tutor telling us that colonial buildings were designed to breathe, to let air move through thick walls. It had been a sentence in a lecture, a charming note. I wondered if the building was still breathing or if it was gasping. I wondered if I was.

The beam above me made a sound that was not a groan but a pop. It was a sharp, small noise, like a bone snapping under a sudden twist. I sat up and froze. The next lightning flash showed a new split in the beam, a pale line that had not been there before. It was diagonal, a fracture. The beam had begun to break. I felt something in my chest go cold.

"No," I said. It was not a prayer. It was a protest.

Another pop. Another line appeared. The beam flexed. The crack in the ceiling widened. Dust fell in a thicker curtain. I coughed, eyes watering. I wiped my face with my sleeve and tasted grit and salt.

I shoved myself to my feet and backed against the door. The door did not open. I put my hands flat on it and pushed, not because I thought it would open but because I needed to feel something solid. The wood shuddered under my palms. I felt the grain, the damp, the small ridges where my fingers had worn it smooth. It was the most human texture in the room.

The beam groaned again, deeper this time, and the sound felt like it came from inside my own chest. The ceiling bowed. The crack stretched. For a moment I could see the darkness above, a void between the plaster and whatever held the roof. It was empty and black, an unseen space waiting.

Lightning flashed. The room lit. I saw the beam split a fraction more, the fracture widening. I saw the bed frame beneath it, damp and waiting. I saw the mattress on the floor, the water pooled around it, the door behind me, closed like a mouth.

Then the light went out. The dark returned. The building made one more long, splintering sigh.

I held my breath and waited for what came next.
