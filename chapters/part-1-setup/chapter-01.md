# Chapter 01: The Load-Bearing Smile

The stair complained the moment I put my weight on it, a long, animal groan that vibrated up through the rubber soles of my sneakers and into my shins. I froze mid-step, coffee in one hand, keycard in the other, and watched a thin crack in the plaster do the barest little trick of widening and relaxing, like a mouth testing a word.

I told myself the crack was already there. I told myself the building was old and the building was fine. I told myself I’d made worse noises after a red-eye.

Above me, someone laughed, the sound echoing down the stairwell in loose, hollow increments. The laugh had a lot of ceiling in it.

I moved anyway. There are only so many mornings in a row you can decide not to climb a staircase. The math starts to feel personal.

By the time I reached the landing the noise had faded, replaced by a faint tinniness in my ears. The crack, faithful to its role, returned to its hairline pose. I could have let myself think it was all in my head. But there was a dusting of chalky grit on the step I’d just left, like the building had exhaled on it.

When I got to my room, I left the coffee on the windowsill and took a photo of the crack, just in case. Not for an insurance claim or evidence, but because content doesn’t sleep.

The story I posted to my feed said: “The Loom House is *ancient*, you can FEEL the history. Creaks and all.”

There was no way to say “the building is breathing” without sounding dramatic, and I wasn’t trying to get my followers to think I was dramatic. I was trying to sound adventurous. I was trying to sound like the kind of girl who could sleep on a hammock strung between two palm trees and not wake up with a spider on her face. I was trying to sound like the kind of girl who didn’t google “structural collapse hostel.”

That was three hours into Day One. I’m getting ahead of myself.

If you want to arrive somewhere and immediately regret the booking, it helps to do it in the heat of a late afternoon, with your backpack glued to your shoulders and the taste of cheap bus air in your mouth. San Loreto wrapped around the bay like a sloppy hug; the city was all chipped paint and bright murals, pastel houses perched on hills, and an ocean that looked like it had been working overtime. The bus dropped me off in the lower town with a spray of brake dust, and I hauled my life up five blocks of tilt and cobblestone to The Loom House.

From the outside, it looked like the kind of building that used to be a factory and now wanted to be a vibe. It was a wide brick rectangle with ivy climbing the corners and a hand-painted sign advertising cold beer and rooftop sunsets. The sign had a typo—SUTSETS—so I already liked it.

I chose The Loom House because the listing said “historic textile warehouse, lovingly restored,” and because the other option in my price range was a party hostel with a policy against pajamas in the common room. I live with enough rules. I was also running late on a project for a client in Chicago and needed reliable Wi-Fi. The word “lovingly” did a lot of work for me in the booking.

“Welcome! You must be Mara.”

The receptionist’s name tag said NICO in block letters. He wore a black T-shirt that said *MAKE IT HOLD* and had a tiny silver safety pin pierced through one ear. He looked like a man who had tried to become a tattoo artist and then tried to become a bartender and then tried to become a receptionist, which is to say, he looked perfect for a hostel.

“Yes,” I said, and dropped my backpack with relief. “Mara Patel.”

He handed me a clipboard and a pen that still had the plastic shrink-wrap around it. “We’re old-fashioned. Paper check-in. It’s part of the charm.”

“Sure,” I said, and glanced at the lobby. It was high-ceilinged and dim, the light filtered through dusty skylights. There was a faint smell of bleach fighting with fried onions. The couch had a patchwork blanket thrown across it like a hashtag.

Nico slid my keycard across the counter. “You’re in Dorm 4B. Third floor. If you need help with your bag, I—”

“I’m good,” I said. “Thanks.”

He watched me hoist the backpack, the way people watch someone lifting a box they can’t see into. “The stairs are… spirited,” he said, and then smiled. “Don’t take it personally if they squeak.”

“They won’t,” I said.

That was my first mistake, and I knew it the moment the words left my mouth. I don’t believe in tempting fate, but I do believe in tempting gravity. I went to a university where the Civil Engineering building was all glass and pride, and gravity always won. I left that program after year two. I liked the equations; I liked the control. I didn’t like the idea of a career spent signing off on the idea that everything would be fine. I switched to UX design because it felt safer to make digital mistakes. My mother still tells people I’m “in engineering.”

Nico handed me a laminated card with the Wi-Fi password and some rules.

“No towels on the railing,” he said. “Quiet hours after eleven. Do not move the bunks. And please, please, don’t climb on the roof parapet. It’s not load-bearing.”

He said the last part in the same tone as a joke. I laughed. It sounded like a rule that existed because someone had tested it.

“What happened?” I asked.

“A sunset got very exciting,” he said, and winked.

I took the keycard and the rules and, for a second, I glanced at the lobby wall, where a framed certificate hung slightly crooked. *Historic Building Preservation Award, 1998.* Under the glass, the paper was wavy at the edges like it had been saved from a flood.

I asked Nico if the building had been renovated recently.

“Last year,” he said. “New pipes, new paint, the roof beams got love. The whole city is restoration. We live in history here. It’s beautiful.” He spread his hands. There was dust caught in the light like tiny confetti.

The receptionist behind him, a woman in a yellow hoodie, rolled her eyes so subtly I would have missed it if I hadn’t made eye contact.

“Cool,” I said, and headed toward the staircase.

The first step creaked so loud the wall flinched.

---

Dorm 4B was a twelve-bed room with peeling teal walls and tall windows that looked out onto the port. I got there to find my bunk already claimed in the good sense: someone had thrown their backpack on it, but no one was in it yet. It was the lower bunk. The lower bunk was my first choice until I saw the view from the upper bunks, which made the bay look like a postcard and the city look like it was already past sunset.

“Hey,” I said to the empty room. “Is anyone in here?”

The room smelled like coconut sunscreen and damp shoes. The ceiling was high enough that a rope of fairy lights had been strung across it like a hazard. They were off.

I pulled the backpack off the lower bunk and set it on the floor. I didn’t ask permission because there was no one to ask, and I didn’t worry because I always assume I can explain later. I claimed the top bunk by moving my stuff onto it and wedging my suitcase under the frame.

The bed itself was a metal frame bolted to the floor. It rattled when I climbed, and I could feel the vibration in my knees, the whole mattress doing a tiny shiver. I stood up and grabbed the top railing. It was cool and slightly tacky, probably from too many sunscreened hands.

Outside, the sky was a good shade of bruised purple. The port was alive with cranes, like the skyline was sprouting arms. I snapped a photo through the grime on the window. It came out moody and cinematic, which in my language means “good enough to post.”

I pulled the curtains closed because I needed to work and because the sun, even at its best, doesn’t care about my deadlines.

A girl with a shaved head and a canvas tote showed up fifteen minutes later and stopped in the doorway.

“You took my bed,” she said.

I turned and smiled. “Sorry. I didn’t know anyone was in here. You can have it back if you want.”

She looked at the bunk, at the window, and then at me. “Is the top wobbly?”

“A little,” I said.

“Fine,” she said, and took the lower bunk, pulling her tote out and plopping onto the mattress like it was a hammock.

I told myself that was considerate.

Her name was June. She was from Montreal and she was in San Loreto for a week because her ex had booked the trip and she kept the tickets out of spite. She had a dry way of talking about it, like she was narrating a documentary about a sinking ship. I liked her immediately.

“Did they warn you about the roof?” she asked.

“There’s a roof rule,” I said. “No parapet climbing. Because of the load-bearing.”

She snorted. “Everything is load-bearing until it isn’t.”

“That’s my senior quote,” I said, and then caught myself. There are only so many jokes you can make about structures before it starts to feel like a confession.

June pulled out a paperback and a packet of gummy bears. “Do you work?” she asked.

“Remote,” I said. “UX stuff.”

“So you can go anywhere and still be trapped by your job.”

“Exactly.”

There was a scratchy sound above us, like someone dragging furniture across the floor. The ceiling at the corner of the room had a faint spiderweb of cracks. I didn’t comment, and neither did June. The hardest part about hostels isn’t sharing space. It’s agreeing on what to ignore.

I set up my laptop on the bed, the fan already humming, and took an hour to answer emails. Outside, the city shifted into evening. Inside, the air shifted into the smell of garlic and old wood.

When I finally shut the laptop, I had a headache shaped like fluorescent lighting. I looked at the time and saw the word “bar” in my future.

---

The common room was in what used to be the weaving hall. If you looked at the ceiling you could still see the hooks where machinery had hung, an industrial skeleton pinned in place and repurposed. There were sofas made of repurposed pallets, a long wooden table, and a bar that leaned just slightly to the left. The tilt could have been design. It could have been gravity. It could have been both.

A chalkboard menu listed “Happy Hour – 2x1 pisco sours” and “Tonight: Trivia + Basement Tour.” The words “Basement Tour” had a question mark next to them.

I ordered a beer, the cheapest one. The bartender, a woman with a streak of gray in her braid, slid it across the bar with the caution of someone who had spilled too many.

“First time in San Loreto?” she asked.

“First time in The Loom House,” I said.

She smiled. “Ah. You will either love it or you will have a story.”

“A story is good for engagement,” I said.

She raised an eyebrow. “Are you famous?”

“Only if you’re a 27-year-old who needs tips on budget travel.”

“Then yes,” she said, deadpan.

I took a sip. The beer tasted like metal and triumph. I picked a seat near a column and watched the room come alive. There was a German backpacker teaching someone how to play a card game involving slapping. There was a couple in matching linen outfits whispering over a map. There was a guy in a fluorescent tank top who kept saying the word “vibes” like it was a metric.

June wandered in and flopped onto the couch beside me. “Did you see the basement tour?” she asked.

“It has a question mark,” I said. “That means yes.”

“Or it means they’re not sure the stairs will hold.”

“Spicy,” I said, and toasted her.

Nico appeared with a tray of shot glasses. “Welcome drinks,” he said. “On the house. The roof is open, sunset in fifteen minutes. Come up. But not on the parapet.”

Everyone laughed, the communal kind of laugh that says “of course I would never.”

The roof was accessed by a narrow staircase that twisted up from the back of the hall. I followed the pack, beer in hand, enjoying the breeze. The staircase had a wooden handrail polished by a century of hands. The steps were worn at the center, a concave dip that made my foot feel like it was being accepted.

We stepped onto the rooftop terrace, which had a waist-high brick wall and a series of mismatched chairs. Strings of bulbs were draped between metal poles. The city was a spill of light, the ocean a dark line beyond. I could smell salt and grilled meat. I could hear a band somewhere down the hill testing a sound system.

“This is why I came,” I said, and put my phone on the wall to frame the shot.

I leaned back to get the whole skyline, and felt the wall vibrate lightly. A breeze, I told myself. I added a filter. I listened to the chatter around me.

A British guy with a beard was telling a story about a hostel in Prague where the ceiling had collapsed onto a bunk bed at three a.m. “No one died,” he said, like that was part of the fun.

“Why would you stay in a place like that?” June asked.

He shrugged. “You can’t live scared, can you?”

“Can’t live very long either,” she said.

Nico clinked a spoon against a glass for attention. “The terrace can hold twenty people comfortably,” he announced. “If we go over, the city council will cry. Let’s not make them cry.”

I counted in my head, habit without reason. There were eighteen of us. It was fine. It was always fine.

The sun dropped behind the hills, and the sky went orange and then red and then a purple so deep it made the water look black. I caught myself feeling lucky, even in the heat, even in the debt, even in the mess of my life. The building felt solid under me. The view was its own argument.

After the light faded, we went back downstairs. The stairs had a soft, synchronized squeak, like the building was singing. We returned to the common room, louder, a little drunk. Trivia started. The basement tour never did.

“Why is there no basement tour?” I asked the bartender when I ordered a second beer.

She leaned in. “Because the basement is not a tour. It’s a storage space that smells like mold and old ghosts.”

“And you don’t want us in there?”

“I don’t want me in there,” she said.

I put down another note in my head. Hostel basements, like hostel rooftops, are always interesting. They are also where they keep the things they can’t sell on Instagram.

The night moved like it wanted to be gone. I played a round of trivia with June and lost to a couple of Australians who knew a suspicious amount about currency conversions. When the game ended, someone suggested a night walk. Someone else suggested staying in. I chose the middle road of “go upstairs.”

“Watch the stairs,” Nico called after me as I left the common room. “They bite.”

“They should put that on the booking page,” I said.

He smiled. It was an easy, practiced smile. It made me trust him.

I regret this, but I took my beer with me.

---

Dorm 4B was darker now, lit by the halo of the streetlight outside. June was already in bed, reading by the glow of her phone. I clambered up to the top bunk, set my beer on the windowsill, and kicked off my shoes. The mattress was thin. The sheet was too clean, the kind of clean you can tell is chemical. My phone buzzed with a notification: a client wanted a revision. I ignored it. The bed creaked as I shifted.

“Is it just me,” June said, “or does this room move?”

I lay still and listened. There was a faint, constant hum, like the building was turning its own pages. There were city sounds: a motorcycle, a distant shout, the clink of dishes from the kitchen. There was something else under it, a low tremor. I felt it in my teeth more than my bones.

“It’s just old,” I said.

“Everything is just old until it falls,” June said, and turned off her phone.

I stared up at the ceiling. The fairy lights were dark, the cords hanging in catenary arcs that felt too mathematical to be decorative. I could see the lines of the cracks, the way they branched like dry riverbeds across the plaster. I thought about how walls carry loads and how loads carry memory.

When I was twelve, my father took me to see a bridge in Gujarat that had been shut down. He had driven us out of our way on a road trip to show me what failure looked like. The bridge was made of stone and wire and stubbornness, and it had given up. My father stood with his hands in his pockets and told me, “Everything has a limit. People too.”

He would have hated the way I treated buildings now, like scenery.

My phone buzzed again. I ignored it again. The room was too full of other people's lives, too full of the quiet in between their sounds. I pulled the curtain aside and peered at the city. There was a fog over the port now. The cranes looked like instruments in an orchestra at rest.

I took a photo of the fog. I thought about posting it. I did not. Some things are better unshared.

The bed creaked as I turned, a high-pitched metal complaint. I could feel the frame vibrating. It was probably my imagination. It was probably the train tracks a few blocks away. It was probably the building adjusting to night.

I closed my eyes and tried to sleep.

The thing about sleeping in a room full of strangers is that you learn their night sounds quickly. June breathed in through her nose and out through her mouth. The girl across the room snored like a dying fan. Someone above me kicked the wall in their sleep. The building popped, once, like a finger joint.

At midnight, a truck rumbled past outside, and the whole room shivered. My mattress slid a fraction of an inch. The metal frame squealed. A fine dust floated down from the ceiling. It landed on my cheek and tasted like chalk.

I opened my eyes. The crack above my bed had grown. It wasn’t dramatic, not a cinematic split, just a thin line that now had a companion, two hairlines running in parallel. I told myself I’d measure it in the morning, but I didn’t have a ruler, and I wasn’t an engineer anymore, and I was too tired to care.

“June,” I whispered.

She didn’t answer. I rolled onto my side and watched the crack until it blurred.

The building creaked again, a deeper sound than before, like a throat clearing. I imagined its beams, old as my grandparents, shifting against their nails. I imagined the brick exhaling the day. I imagined it still holding.

I know how that sounds. Like I wanted it to be haunted. Like I was bored. I wasn’t bored. I was tired, and my brain likes to entertain itself at 1 a.m. with its own unease.

In the dark, my phone lit up. A message from a client: “Need this by morning, sorry.” I stared at it until the light hurt my eyes. I thought about my bank account, my flight in three weeks, my rent back home, the way my parents said, “So when are you coming back to a real job?”

I thought about the stairs and the crack and the old building and how every structure was a trade-off between safety and cost. I thought about the way I’d chosen this hostel because it was cheap and pretty and perfectly framed for a feed.

I turned my phone face-down. I could do the work in the morning. The building could hold until then.

Somewhere in the hall, a door slammed. The air shifted. The bed frame vibrated with the impact, and for a second my stomach did that tiny drop like the top of a rollercoaster. The fairy lights swayed. The ceiling made a small, dry sound, like paper tearing very slowly.

I sat up. The room was still. The girl snoring did not wake. June did not move. The crack above my bed did not look larger. I listened. I heard nothing but my own blood.

I should have gotten down. I should have told Nico. I should have asked for a lower bunk. I should have left.

I stayed. I watched the crack. I told myself the building was fine.

When you travel long enough, you learn to make quick judgments. You decide if a street is safe, if a driver is sober, if the water is potable. You decide if a smile is friendly or a scam. You decide if a building is simply old or actively trying to kill you. You learn to trust your instincts, but also your ego, and you learn the difference only after it costs you.

I fell asleep to the sound of something shifting deep in the walls, a slow, patient noise, like a tongue testing a loose tooth.

I woke again around three. The room was hotter. The fan, a small oscillating thing on the floor, was off. It had died in its sleep. I could hear the city again, the hum of a night bus, a dog barking at nothing. The building was quiet in a way that felt intentional. The air smelled faintly metallic, like wet coins.

I reached for my water bottle, knocked it over, and watched it roll across the mattress toward the wall. It stopped at a slight angle, and I realized the bed had tilted. I stared at it. I put the bottle down again and watched it roll a fraction of an inch toward the corner.

My mouth went dry. I sat up, slow. The room felt the same. The world felt the same. Only the bed, and the angle, and my perception had changed.

Then, from somewhere within the building, deep and hollow, came a crack. Not a creak. Not a pop. A crack, sharp and final, like a branch snapping in the forest. The sound was so loud it felt close. The bed frame shuddered.

I grabbed the railing. The wall across from me trembled. A tiny dust waterfall poured from a seam above the window.

“June,” I said, louder.

She stirred. “What?”

The crack came again, lower this time, like the building had answered itself.

I looked at the door. The hallway beyond was black. I could hear footsteps, or I imagined them. My heart beat in a way that made my ears ring.

“Is this normal?” June asked.

“Probably,” I said.

The building exhaled.

Then everything went quiet.

And in the silence, I could hear the sound of the stairwell, far away, making the smallest possible noise, the way a mouth sounds when it starts to whisper.
