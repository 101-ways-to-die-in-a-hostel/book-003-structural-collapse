# Chapter 02: The Heritage Room

Emma signed the waiver with a pen that barely worked, the ink scratching its way across the page like it was reluctant to be part of whatever she was agreeing to.

She did not read it. She meant to. She really did. But the lobby was humid and dim, and the man behind the desk was watching her with the careful patience of someone who has seen this scene a hundred times. There was a line behind her, a German couple with matching pack covers and an American who smelled like sunscreen and tequila. There was a fan on the counter that did not point at her. There was a part of her that could already feel the photo she would take of the room, framed by a mosquito net and a beam old enough to have outlived her country. The future story was already writing itself, and in it she did not pause to read a waiver about structural integrity.

She signed. The pen squeaked. The page accepted her name.

---

The hostel called itself Casa Colonial Los Muertos, which Emma would later translate as Colonial House of the Dead and then tell herself that she was being dramatic about it. For now, it was just a name painted in flaking black letters above a doorway, the kind of doorway that swallowed light. It was the beginning of Day One in Cartagena, the afternoon heat spiking and curling, and she was sweaty enough to have stopped caring whether her linen pants were making her look like a Pinterest board.

The taxi had dropped her a block away because the street was blocked by a cart selling mango slices. The driver had shrugged, as if saying, this is just how the city is, and she had shrugged back, as if saying, this is just how travel is. She had rolled her suitcase over the cobblestones and felt her teeth vibrate with every bump. She had stopped, twice, to adjust her backpack and tell herself that she was not fragile. She was not fragile. She was a Cambridge admit with a gap year, a girl who read The Economist on planes and knew how to say "intersectional" without flinching. She was supposed to be good at being uncomfortable.

Casa Colonial sat in Getsemani, a neighborhood that travel blogs described as "edgy" and "authentic" in the way a menu described a dish as "rustic." The street smelled like fried arepas and sea salt and horse manure from a carriage that had passed too recently. Salsa thumped from somewhere around the corner. A church bell tolled the hour, its sound heavy and old, and she felt a little thrill of being inside a world older than her own.

Inside the hostel, the air was cooler, but only by comparison. The lobby was painted white once, and then white again, and then again, until the walls looked thick enough to be geological. A courtyard sat in the center, its fountain cracked and dry, its tiles slick with humidity. Hammocks hung in the shade, the fabric sagging like tired flags. The smell of mildew was faint, but present, the way a memory is present: not aggressive, just impossible to ignore once you notice it.

"Hola," the man at reception said. He wore a polo shirt and looked like he had not slept well in a long time. His name tag read CARLOS. He glanced at her passport, then back to her. "Emma Hartwell?"

"Yes," she said, and put on the careful brightness she used for people who controlled her bed for the night. "I have a reservation. The Heritage Room." She tried to say it casually, as if that was a normal room request and not a blog-informed declaration of taste.

Carlos's mouth made a small shape, a tiny compression that could have been a smile or a wince. "Ah, Historia," he said. He fished her reservation out of a stack of printed papers and slid it toward her. "We have you for three nights, yes?"

"Yes," she said. "And I booked Historia. The oldest one."

He hesitated. "There is also Seguro," he said, and then added, "Safe. It is newer. Same price."

Emma smiled. "I read about it. I want Historia. I want the original building."

"It is very original," he said, the way someone says the soup is very hot.

She leaned over the counter, signed her name in the blank space, and then, because she had come halfway around the world to be a certain version of herself, she asked, "Is it really from the 1600s?"

Carlos nodded. "1624. This city was a very busy port. The house was for a merchant. Very rich."

"That's incredible," she said, and felt herself smile with genuine pleasure. The year 1624 had texture in her mind. It was the English Civil War, it was early modern, it was the beginning of things. Her entire life was a footnote compared to that.

"It is also old," he said, and then, quickly, "And charming. Very charming."

Emma laughed. "Old is good. It's why I'm here."

Carlos slid a clipboard toward her. "Just sign this. For the heritage wing. It is, um, more rustic."

"Of course," she said, and signed without reading. She was not a person who signed things without reading them. She was a person who read things. She had opinions about consent forms. She had written essays on negligence. But it was hot, and there was a line, and the man was waiting, and she didn't want to be the kind of tourist who made a scene over a hostel waiver.

She told herself she would read it later.

"Breakfast is simple," Carlos said. "Bread, fruit, coffee. The Wi-Fi is strongest in the courtyard. There is only one shower in the heritage wing, so maybe use the one in the modern wing if you are in a hurry. And..." He paused. "If you need anything, let me know."

She took the key, a brass key attached to a heavy wooden tag that said HISTORIA in capital letters, and felt the weight of it in her hand. She liked that. It felt like a prop. It made her feel like she was staying in something more than a dorm.

"Gracias," she said.

As she turned to go, a woman with gray hair and a mop bucket crossed the hallway. She stopped at the threshold of the corridor to the heritage wing, crossed herself, and veered away without looking down it.

Emma watched her for a second, and then told herself that old women were superstitious everywhere.

---

The stairway to the heritage wing did not squeak so much as it complained in a long, slow register. The steps were terracotta, worn in the center by four hundred years of feet, and she felt the dip under her sandals as if the building had learned the shape of human weight. The walls were thick enough that the air was cooler, and she could see the outlines of old repairs in the plaster where someone had tried to make history look clean.

She passed a sign that said QUIET HOURS AFTER 11, and another that said NO OUTSIDE GUESTS, and then, as if the building were a person with a sense of humor, another that said HERITAGE WING GUESTS MUST SIGN WAIVER.

She wanted to take a photo of it. She did not. It felt too on-the-nose.

Room Historia was at the end of a hallway that narrowed as it went. The door was heavy and rubbed against the floor when she pushed it open. The room smelled like old wood, damp stone, and a faint rot that reminded her of the river back home after a rain.

It was beautiful.

The beams were the first thing she saw. They ran across the ceiling in thick, dark lines, each one scarred and pitted, each one a piece of history holding the roof up out of habit. The walls were whitewashed and uneven. The floor slanted slightly toward the outer wall, and her suitcase rolled on its own for a few inches before it caught on a crack in the tile.

There were four metal bunk beds, all painted a uniform gray that did not belong in a room like this. A mosquito net hung over each, tied up in a polite bundle like curtains waiting to be drawn. The window shutters were carved wood, heavy and warped, and one of them hung at an angle as if it had been giving up for a long time.

Emma stood in the center of the room and turned slowly, taking it all in. She wanted to touch everything. She wanted to photograph the light that streamed through the slats of the shutters and lit the dust like a stage effect. She wanted to say, out loud, that this was why she traveled.

She found the bed with the best light, the lower bunk by the window, and dropped her bag onto it. The mattress was thin, and the metal frame sank slightly into the floor as she leaned her weight on it. She told herself that uneven floors were charming. She told herself that old buildings moved. She told herself that her physics teacher would be proud of her for thinking about forces, and then she laughed at herself for thinking about her physics teacher at nineteen.

There was a note taped to the wall by the door: "Room Historia was closed for renovations. We are happy to welcome you back. Please enjoy the authentic experience." The paper was yellowed. The tape was old. She read it twice and felt a small, private thrill. She was staying somewhere that had been closed, and reopened, and now she was in it. She was inside the story.

She set her phone on the bed, opened the camera, and took a photo of the ceiling. The beam in the center sagged slightly, just enough to be noticed if you were looking for it. She cropped the shot so the sag looked deliberate and then wrote a caption in her head: Four hundred years of stories. Sometimes authenticity means accepting imperfection.

She did not post it yet. She liked to sit on a caption for a while, to see if it still felt clever.

A gecko chirped from somewhere near the window. She smiled and turned, and as she did, a small gray body fell from the ceiling and landed on her shoulder. It clung for a second, then skittered down her arm and onto the bed.

"Hi," she said, startled and delighted. "Hello."

The gecko looked at her with eyes that were all lid and no expression, then disappeared behind the mosquito net.

She laughed, and said out loud, "This is why I came," as if the building were listening.

In the hallway, she heard footsteps and the low sound of Spanish voices. A man passed the open door and looked in, then immediately looked away. He was local, maybe in his twenties, and he wore a white shirt and carried a bucket. He muttered something under his breath that sounded like "no, no," and kept going.

Emma told herself he was being polite, that he didn't want to intrude. She did not tell herself that he did not want to be in the room.

She unpacked her bag and lined her things along the bed: her journal, her reading glasses, her battered copy of One Hundred Years of Solitude with sticky notes hanging out of it like flags. She took her vintage band T-shirt off, put on a clean one, and then put the dirty one on the back of her chair because she did not have a real chair.

She tried the shutters. They wouldn't close all the way. The wood scraped against the frame and stopped, leaving a gap of light that could have been intentional. She pulled anyway. The shutter rattled and then, with a small cough of dust, held.

She sat on the bed and listened. The building made a constant low noise, a shifting sound that could have been the wind or the beams settling. There was the chirp of a gecko, the distant clink of dishes in the kitchen, the thud of a door somewhere below. There was a faint creak above her head, a sound like wood rubbing itself raw.

The air was thick. She could taste the salt from the sea and the sweet of mango from the street. She could taste the dust in the room. She could taste the sweat on her own upper lip.

She texted her mother that she had arrived safely.

Her mother responded immediately: Are you in a safe place? Remember what I said about old buildings. Love you.

Emma put her phone face down and smiled at the ceiling.

---

She went out before the heat could settle into night. The door to Casa Colonial let her out into a street that smelled of frying oil and rain on hot stone. She walked toward the walled city, past balconies heavy with bougainvillea and pastel facades that looked freshly painted until you got close enough to see the peeling. Horse-drawn carriages clopped by, their drivers calling to tourists in a sing-song Spanish she could only half understand. A line of students trailed behind a tour guide who held a tiny yellow umbrella aloft like a standard in a war she was not part of.\n+\n+She walked without a map on purpose, because getting lost felt like a thing serious travelers did. She passed a church with an open door and stopped just long enough to smell the incense and hear the murmur of a mass in progress. The voices floated out into the heat and faded as she moved on.\n+\n+She bought a mango from a woman with a cart and the mango was cold and sweet and sharp, the kind of sweetness that felt almost disrespectful in a place that had been built on sugar and blood. She thought about the way the travel blogs talked about Cartagena, about the layering of colonial beauty and colonial violence, and felt both smart and small at the same time.\n+\n+She took photos of a balcony with a rusted iron railing and a man in a white shirt hanging laundry. She took photos of a cat sleeping in a doorway, its ribs visible under its fur. She took a photo of a plaque that said HISTORIC PROPERTY and thought about how the word historic could be a compliment or a warning. She didn't post any of them yet. She wanted to add a thoughtful caption, something that said she understood the context. She told herself that understanding could be captured in a caption.\n+\n+Back at the hostel, she found the kitchen in a state of gentle chaos. Someone was making eggs in a pan that might not have been washed since breakfast. Someone else was chopping onions with a blunt knife. The air was thick with heat and garlic. Emma stood in the doorway for a moment, then decided to skip cooking. She hadn't eaten enough all day, but she also didn't want to announce herself to a group of strangers by asking for the frying pan.\n+\n+She went to put her mango peel in the trash and saw Marta, the cleaner, wringing out a mop. Marta nodded at her, then looked past her toward the heritage hallway. Her face did a familiar thing: a quiet refusal. She lifted the mop and turned away.\n+\n+Emma watched her for a beat too long. She wanted to ask, Why? She didn't, because asking locals about their superstitions always felt like a kind of appropriation. She told herself that her restraint was respectful rather than cowardly.\n+\n+She headed back to her room and noticed, for the first time, how the hallway narrowed toward Historia, how the walls seemed to press in. The air felt cooler there, and damp. A faint line of plaster dust trailed along the baseboard, as if the building had shed a thin skin. She bent down, rubbed the dust between her fingers, and saw that it was fine and chalky, like ground eggshell.\n+\n+She told herself old buildings shed.\n+\n+In the room, the sag in the beam looked the same as it had when she left. She told herself she was checking it for a baseline. That was a science thing to do, and she liked herself more when she could call something a science thing. She slid her journal from her bag and wrote one line: The house is a body, and it is tired. She underlined tired and felt pleased with herself.\n+\n+Outside, the sky had started to bruise again. A distant rumble rolled across the rooftops, not quite thunder, not quite traffic. Emma paused with her pen in midair, then kept writing.\n+\n+---\n+\n By late afternoon, the heat had gone a shade softer, and the courtyard filled with travelers with damp hair and wide shoulders. Emma sat at one of the plastic tables and sipped a coffee that tasted like burnt sugar. She opened her journal and pretended to write, but mostly she watched people.
By late afternoon, the heat had gone a shade softer, and the courtyard filled with travelers with damp hair and wide shoulders. Emma sat at one of the plastic tables and sipped a coffee that tasted like burnt sugar. She opened her journal and pretended to write, but mostly she watched people.

There was a Dutch couple comparing insect bites. There was a group of Australians who kept calling each other "mate" in a way that was either affectionate or a warning. There was a solo American with a baseball cap and a Spanish phrasebook, flipping pages like he could absorb grammar by osmosis.

Emma watched them and felt the familiar blend of superiority and loneliness. She told herself she wasn't like them. She was here to learn, to study the city, to think about colonialism and the way architecture could be a physical record of oppression. She was here to be thoughtful. She was here because she had read that Cartagena was a palimpsest, a layered text of history, and she wanted to be the kind of person who could read it.

She could also feel her mother in her pocket, vibrating through the phone every hour with another check-in. She ignored most of them. She was nineteen and in Colombia and had to prove, to someone, that she could handle herself. She did not admit that the someone was mostly herself.

Carlos walked through the courtyard with a stack of clean sheets. He looked tired. When he saw her, he nodded.

"How is the room?" he asked.

"Amazing," Emma said, and meant it. "It's beautiful."

He opened his mouth as if to say something, then closed it. "It is... yes. Beautiful. If you need anything, please."

She thought about asking him why it had been closed, about the note on the wall, about the way the floor tilted. Instead she asked where the best place to watch the sunset was.

He pointed up. "Rooftop. But only for a little. It is old too."

She laughed. "Everything is old here."

"Not you," he said, and smiled with a tiredness that made her feel guilty.

She made a note in her journal to look up the history of the building and to use the word "palimpsest" in a caption. She wrote one sentence about the courtyard fountain, and then her pen hovered and did nothing.

The Wi-Fi in the courtyard was barely a pulse. She tried to upload a photo and watched it fail at 80%. She deleted it and decided that was a sign to be present. She told herself that being present meant staying in the oldest room in the oldest wing of a building that had outlasted empires.

She went up to the rooftop just before sunset. The view was the promised one, the city glowing gold, the Caribbean a smear of blue. She took photos, posed her coffee cup in the corner of the frame, and told herself that she was documenting beauty, not performing it. When she posted, she wrote, In Cartagena, history sits on your shoulder like a bird. It was too much. She left it.

Back in her room, she changed into linen pants and a band T-shirt, brushed her teeth in the heritage wing bathroom with its stubborn faucet and the cracked mirror, and then stood in the doorway for a moment and listened to the building.

She thought she could hear it breathing.

A brief rain shower came in around seven, sudden and violent. It hit the shutters like handfuls of gravel. The wind hissed through the slats and made the room feel alive. Emma stood by the window, watching the courtyard darken, and felt the building groan, a long wooden complaint that vibrated through the floor into her bare feet.

She told herself old buildings made noise when it rained.

She texted June, the friend she'd met in Mexico the week before, a photo of the rain and a joke about sleeping in history. June texted back a skull emoji. Emma laughed, then stopped, because the groan had come again, deeper this time, like a throat clearing before a confession.

She looked up. The beam over her bed sagged in the middle, a soft dip that might have always been there. A fine line of plaster ran parallel to it, a faint crack that was easy to ignore if you didn't want to see it.

She took a photo.

---

Later that night, the courtyard was quiet. The other travelers had gone out to salsa clubs or to bed, and the only light came from the Wi-Fi spot, a single bulb that attracted moths like gossip. Emma sat on a plastic chair with her phone pressed to her ear, listening to her mother ask her what she had eaten, if she had met anyone nice, if she had remembered to lock her locker.

"Mum," she said, and tried to keep her voice light. "It's fine."

"You say that in a way that makes me think it's not fine," her mother said. The line crackled. "Are you all right, Em?"

She looked at the courtyard fountain, the crack down its side that let a thin line of water leak into the tiles. She looked at the doorway to the heritage wing, the shadow beyond it darker than it should have been. She looked at her hand, the ink stains on her fingers from journaling. She swallowed.

"I'm tired," she said, and then, because she was not as good at being detached as she thought, she said, "I miss home."

There was a pause. Her mother's voice softened. "You can come home," she said. "You don't have to prove anything."

Emma laughed, a small, sad sound. "I do, though."

"To who?"

Emma opened her mouth and closed it. The air smelled like mildew and wet stone. The night insects sang. Somewhere in the building, a door slammed.

"To me," she said, and then, because she heard how pathetic it sounded, she added, "It's just... I want to do this right. I want to have a real gap year. Not just a holiday."

"You're allowed to have a holiday," her mother said. "That's why we told you to take the year in the first place. You don't need to turn it into an essay."

Emma smiled, and felt a tear she hadn't expected. She wiped it with the heel of her hand and hoped no one was watching. She had read that crying in public was seen as charming in some countries. She suspected that was a lie invented by people who looked good when they cried.

"I'll be okay," she said.

"Promise?"

"Promise."

They said goodnight. Emma stared at her phone for a moment before putting it down. The courtyard felt larger without her mother's voice in it.

She went back upstairs. The hallway to the heritage wing was dark, the walls absorbing light. She used her phone as a torch and walked past the sign about the waiver. She unlocked her door. The key turned with effort, like it was not used to being moved so often.

The room was cooler now, the rain having taken the edge off the heat. The mosquito nets hung like ghosts. The shadows between the bunks felt thick. Emma climbed into her bed and pulled the net around her, the fabric brushing her arms, and it felt, briefly, like safety.

She opened One Hundred Years of Solitude and read the first paragraph twice without absorbing it. Her mind kept drifting to the beam above her. She told herself she was being dramatic. She told herself she was a writer and writers noticed things.

She closed the book and turned off her phone.

In the dark, the building creaked. The sound was soft, slow, almost tender. Somewhere in the courtyard, a gecko chirped.

Emma lay on her back and watched the shadows on the ceiling, the way the beam cut them into shapes. She was alone in the heritage wing tonight. Carlos had said something about low season. She had nodded and felt pleased at the thought of a quiet room. She had not considered the part where quiet meant no one within shouting distance.

Outside, the street had gone to sleep. The rain had stopped, but the air still felt heavy, as if holding water it had not yet released. The weather report that morning had mentioned a tropical storm out at sea, a name she couldn't remember. She had liked the way the reporter said it, casually, like the storm was just another tourist.

The beam above her gave a small, low groan, and the sound moved through the room like a sigh. Emma smiled in the dark, and whispered to no one, "History doesn't like to be disturbed."

She fell asleep thinking about how she would describe the room in her future memoir.

In the night, the storm kept moving toward the coast.
