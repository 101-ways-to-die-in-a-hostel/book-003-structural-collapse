# Chapter 08: The Cost of Staying

The gecko fell on my pillow like a blessing and a warning.

I woke to the soft thud and the sensation of something small and cool touching my cheek. My eyes snapped open, the room still gray with early light. The gecko blinked at me, its translucent skin too close, its tiny toes splayed in surprised apology. It had dropped from a hairline crack in the ceiling, a clean little exit, as if the building had finally shed a secret it had been holding.

“Okay,” I whispered, and lifted it off the pillow with two fingers. It clung to me, indifferent, then scurried up the wall toward the nearest beam. It paused there, as if to look back. I wanted to interpret it as a sign. I did not know of what.

The crack above my bed was wider than it had been last night. Not dramatically. Just enough that the gecko had fit through. A thin line of plaster had flaked off, leaving a bare strip of old adobe like a scab peeled back. I sat up and stared at it, trying to tell the difference between a morning exaggeration and actual change.

I reached for my phone out of habit and took a photo, angling it so the beam looked romantic and the crack looked almost intentional. The photo made the damage look like design, the way filters make a bruise look like a shadow. I stared at it for a long moment, thumb hovering over the share icon. The urge to post it was a tug, familiar and petty. Authenticity, I reminded myself, wasn’t just about the picture. It was about not turning everything into a picture. I closed the camera without uploading and felt both virtuous and unsatisfied.

There was dust on my pillow, a fine peppering that caught the light. I brushed it off and watched it drift down toward the floor, where it joined a tiny pile at the bed’s leg. Termite frass, I thought, because that was a word I knew and liked the sound of. Little coffins of wood. I could feel my brain trying to turn it into a metaphor. I told it to stop.

I could feel the weight of the beam even when I looked away. It was a body in the room. It had always been, but now it felt less like history and more like a decision that was waiting for a verdict.

I opened my journal and wrote the first sentence before I could stop myself: The building is shedding its witnesses.

That was too dramatic, so I crossed out shedding and wrote releasing instead. That felt worse. I left it anyway.

---

The hallway was damp and faintly chalky, the smell of wet plaster lingering like a bad memory. I carried the gecko out on my palm and let it go at the window where the light was brightest. It vanished into a seam in the wall, as if it knew exactly where the building hid its soft spots.

Marta was there with her mop, moving the bucket across the floor in slow, careful pulls. She glanced at me, then at my hand, and then at the ceiling above Historia. She made the sign of the cross without a word, quick and habitual, and looked away.

“Morning,” I said.

She smiled, polite but guarded. “Buenos días.”

I wanted to ask her about the gecko, about the crack, about the building’s mood. Instead I asked her if the shower was working, because that felt like a question she would answer.

“The water is on,” she said. “Sometimes. If you are lucky.”

I laughed because it was early and because the alternative felt too heavy. She moved on to the next patch of floor, her mop a quiet, insistent swish. A gecko’s tail flicked from a crack near the baseboard, and I wondered how many of them lived inside the walls, listening to the same creaks I did.

In the bathroom, the mirror had a new spiderweb of condensation in the corner where the crack ran. The shower coughed once, then produced a thin stream that went lukewarm after ten seconds. I stood under it anyway, letting the water rinse away the dust on my skin. The tiles were cold under my feet, the grout dark in places where the water never dried. When I turned the tap off, the pipes knocked somewhere in the wall, a hollow thunk that made me freeze with my towel around me. I waited for a follow‑up sound that never came.

Back in the hall, the waiver sign hung slightly crooked, the tape loosening at one corner. I stopped and read it this time, lips moving silently over the phrases: SETTLING, STRUCTURAL MOVEMENT, GUESTS ASSUME ALL RISK. It was neat, bureaucratic language, like a polite list of ways you could be hurt. I touched the edge of the paper and felt the damp. The ink smudged on my thumb.

In the courtyard, the light was already sharp. The broken fountain held a bowl of leaves and a single cigarette butt. The air smelled like coffee and damp stone. June sat at the plastic table with her camera, scrolling through last night’s photos with the concentration of someone arranging evidence.

She looked up. “You look like you got visited by the hostel gods,” she said.

“Gecko,” I said. “It fell on my face. I think that counts.”

She laughed. “It’s a good omen.”

“I’m not sure I believe in omens,” I said.

“Right,” she said. “You believe in… academically sourced discomfort.”

“That’s not a thing,” I said, and then, “It might be a thing.”

Ana arrived with a plate of papaya and bread that was dry enough to squeak. She looked at me, then at June, then back at me. “You stayed in Historia again?” she asked, as if I might have secretly moved in the night.

“I did,” I said. “I’m committed.”

“To the room?” June asked.

“To the story,” I said, and immediately felt like I was admitting something in front of people who hadn’t agreed to be in it.

Ana sipped her coffee. “Stories are for later,” she said. “Safety is for now.”

I opened my mouth to answer and realized I didn’t have a line that didn’t sound like a slogan. I shrugged instead.

June tilted her chin toward the hallway. A local man in a baseball cap had appeared at the threshold, stopped, and turned around without crossing into the heritage wing. He walked back toward the courtyard without looking at any of us.

“They won’t,” Ana said quietly. “You see? They don’t do it.”

“Maybe he just forgot something,” I said, even as I watched him head straight for the front gate.

June’s mouth twitched. “Sure,” she said. “He forgot the entire wing.”

“Carlos is putting new boards in the hallway,” June said. “He asked if anyone wanted to move to Seguro. Apparently there’s more space.”

“I’m fine,” I said, too quickly.

June raised her eyebrows. “No one is taking your identity away if you sleep in a newer building.”

“It’s not about identity,” I said, and then added, “It’s about… I don’t know. It feels like cheating.”

“Cheating what?” Ana asked.

“Cheating the point,” I said. “I came to see the old city, not the refurbished version.”

Ana looked at the courtyard tiles, at the way the sun was making the wet patches steam. “The old city is outside,” she said. “You can sleep anywhere.”

There was a part of me that knew she was right and a part of me that couldn’t afford for her to be. I had written captions about sleeping in history. I had posted the beam like it was a crown. I had argued with strangers in comment sections about the ethics of heritage tourism. Somewhere in the back of my mind was the ledger of my own choices, and on it, Historia had been an expensive entry. If I left, I would have to admit that it had been a mistake, and mistakes were not as photogenic as lessons.

The thought made me feel meaner than I wanted to be. It wasn’t their fault that I had trapped myself inside a narrative. I wanted to say something that sounded nuanced, something about systems and access and the way danger is distributed, but I couldn’t find a sentence that didn’t sound like a performance. So I swallowed it.

I bit into my bread to avoid answering. It tasted like straw. I drank coffee instead and let the bitterness do the talking for me.

By late morning, the heat had climbed back into the courtyard like it owned it. The storm had rinsed the city clean, but it hadn’t taken the humidity with it; it had just rearranged it. The air felt thick and soft, the way a towel feels when you leave it damp for too long.

June wanted to take photos on the rooftop. She said it casually, like a suggestion, not a plan. I said yes before I remembered the rule card and the line about not climbing the parapet. The rule was printed in the same font as the Wi‑Fi password, which made it feel like a suggestion rather than a boundary.

The rooftop access was a narrow stairwell in the modern wing, the kind of back staircase that always smells like dust and bleach. There was a sign on the door that said ROOFTOP CLOSED FOR REPAIRS, the last word underlined in red marker. June pushed the door open anyway, and the hinges complained so loudly I thought we might have announced ourselves to the whole building.

“Closed for repairs means it’s closed for repairs,” I said.

“That’s what the sign says,” she replied. “The door says it opens. I believe the door.”

We stepped out into the sun.

The roof was hot under my sandals, the tiles baking. A low parapet ran along the edge, chipped in places, the plaster peeling. From up there, Cartagena looked like a set built out of bright blocks and old stories: the cathedral dome, the wall circling the old city, the towers that had been rebuilt and repainted and called authentic anyway. The sea was a white sheet in the distance, its surface chopped by wind. Somewhere below, a vendor shouted, and the sound rose like steam.

There were puddles in the corners where the last storm had collected, turning the tiles a darker red. In one puddle, a cigarette butt floated like a tiny wreck. I stepped around it and felt the give of the roof under me, just a fraction, a softness in the tile that might have been a loose grout line or a warning. I pressed my weight onto the other foot and pretended I hadn’t noticed.

June lifted her camera and started shooting. “The light is stupid,” she said, and I knew it was a compliment.

I leaned on the parapet and immediately pulled my hands back. The plaster was warm and gritty, the surface flaking under my fingers. A small piece broke off and landed on my foot like a pale leaf.

“I think this is why it’s closed,” I said.

“Which is exactly why the photo will be good,” June said. She framed the skyline and clicked.

I pulled out my phone and tried to capture the same view. The screen made everything look flatter, like the city had been ironed. I adjusted my angle until the roof’s chipped edge was in the frame. It made the picture feel more honest, or at least more aesthetic.

“Do you ever worry about… you know,” June said, without looking away from her viewfinder.

“Falling?” I asked.

“Falling, collapsing, any of it,” she said. “You don’t look like the reckless type, but you keep choosing the most unstable things.”

“That’s a rude assessment,” I said, but I laughed.

She lowered her camera. “Emma, you wrote an essay about the ethics of bridge design and now you’re sleeping under a four‑hundred‑year‑old beam because it gives you better content.”

“That’s not—” I started, and then stopped. It was, in an embarrassing way, not entirely wrong.

“I’m just saying,” she said. “You’re allowed to be scared and still be interesting.”

The sentence landed like a pebble in my chest. I wanted to pick it up and throw it back, because it felt too close to my mother’s voice, because it felt like the kind of permission I didn’t know I wanted.

“I’m not scared,” I said.

“Sure,” she said. “You’re just committed.”

“I am committed,” I said, and the word sounded like a different kind of vow when it echoed off the rooftop walls.

The wind picked up, a hot gust that smelled like salt and engine exhaust. The roof tiles creaked under it. It was a small, harmless sound, but it made my shoulders lift without my permission. June pretended not to notice. I pretended I hadn’t reacted.

We stayed up there long enough for the heat to feel like a punishment and the city to feel like a painting. When we went back down, the stairwell door stuck for a second, then released with a shudder that ran through the frame. It felt like the building reminding us that doors are choices, too.

In the afternoon, I went to the market by myself. It was easier to breathe in the noise of other people. The market was a bright, sweating maze of fruit and plastic buckets and cardboard boxes. Mangoes sat in neat pyramids. Fish lay on ice, their eyes too clear. A woman in a yellow dress balanced a tray of coconuts on her head, walking like gravity owed her something.

I bought a small bag of guava and ate it as I walked. The seeds stuck in my teeth. The smell of the fish blended with the smell of lime and sweat and frying oil, and the whole place smelled like life insisting on itself. I took photos of a man fixing a fan with wire and a girl painting a sign. I told myself I was capturing the rhythm of the city. I told myself I was not avoiding the room.

A stall near the back sold candles shaped like skulls and tiny paper marigolds. The woman behind it smiled at me and said, “Para los muertos,” and I nodded, pretending I understood more than I did. I picked up a candle that smelled like orange peel and stale smoke. It was too much to carry, I told myself, and set it back down. She said something else in Spanish that I only caught the word abuela in, and I smiled like I was fluent. The candle’s scent followed me as I walked away, sweet and faintly funerary.

Outside the market, a man was patching a wall with plaster, his hands moving fast, his fingers white. He slapped the wet mixture onto the crack, smoothed it, and slapped again. The wall would look whole by sundown. The crack would still be there, under the new skin. I watched him for a moment longer than was polite, then moved on, thinking about the way repairs are mostly performances, too.

On the way back, the sky had the hazy, pale look that meant more rain was thinking about making an appearance. It wasn’t a storm yet. It was a suggestion. The clouds were piled like laundry, heavy and gray at the edges. The humidity grew denser as the light faded, and my shirt clung to my back by the time I reached the hostel gate.

Carlos was in the courtyard, standing by a stack of spare boards. He looked up when he saw me, and the relief on his face was fast enough to make me wonder if he had been counting people.

“You went out,” he said, as if he hadn’t expected anyone to do that.

“I wanted fruit,” I said, and held up the bag of guava.

He smiled, then glanced toward the heritage wing. “We are doing some… fixing,” he said. “Just for the wet.”

I looked at the boards. They were thin and already bowed, scavenged from somewhere else. “Is it serious?” I asked.

He exhaled through his nose. “It is old,” he said, which in this building was the beginning and end of every answer. Then he added, “Maybe the rain tonight will be stronger. If you want to move, it is still possible.”

The offer hung between us, polite and too heavy for a courtyard conversation. I could hear June’s voice in my head, Ana’s, my mother’s. I could hear my own, too, the version of me that had posted about authenticity and meant it.

“I’m fine,” I said.

Carlos nodded as if he had expected that. “Okay. If you change your mind, come to me.” He paused, then added, “If the door sticks, pull hard. The wood swells.”

“Right,” I said, and it felt like a joke that had too many meanings.

He hesitated again, the way people do when they want to say more but can’t decide if they are allowed. “There was a guest last year,” he said, and then stopped. He shook his head. “It is nothing. Just… the old wing gets moody in weather.” He offered a small smile that didn’t quite land. “You are smart. You understand.”

I wanted to say, I understand enough to leave. I wanted to say, I understand just enough to stay. I said, “Thanks,” and felt the small, hollow echo of it in my chest.

In the hallway, I saw what he had been doing. He had nailed a thin strip of wood along one of the cracked wall seams, a neat bandage against a wider wound. The nails were small, their heads shining. The strip did not match the plaster. It looked temporary because it was.

I stopped at my door and turned the key. The lock resisted, then gave. The door opened with a sigh.

Inside, the room smelled like damp paper. The bed looked the same, but the floor did not. I could see it now with a clarity that felt unfair: the slant toward the outer wall was more pronounced, a slow bow like a spine bending. When I put my bag on the bed, the frame sank a fraction into the tile with a metal groan.

I picked up my water bottle and set it on the floor. It rolled. I watched it roll, the way I had done days ago, and felt something cold in my stomach that had nothing to do with water.

I turned the bottle so it leaned against the wall and stayed. It felt like a lie I could touch.

I opened the window shutters to let in air, and one of them stuck halfway, the wood swollen and stubborn. I forced it the rest of the way and it opened with a rasp, shedding a little curl of paint onto the floor. The sound brought to mind fingernails on a chalkboard. I closed my eyes for a second and let the breeze wash over me. It smelled like rain and fried oil and the sea.

The air felt heavy, the way a held breath feels heavy tonight.

On the wall beside the bed, a small line of plaster had buckled. It was no wider than a thread, but it hadn’t been there yesterday. I took a photo, of course. My finger hovered over the delete icon, and then I saved it. Proof, I told myself. Evidence that I was not imagining things. Evidence that I might still be in control of the narrative.

Dinner was rice and beans made by someone who could probably cook better if they had been paid to. I ate in the courtyard with June and Ana and listened to the way the wind moved through the bougainvillea. The sky was the color of wet cement again. The air smelled like the storm before it arrives, the way a room smells before someone tells you bad news.

“Do you have somewhere to go after this?” June asked, the casualness of the question hiding its weight.

“After what?” I asked.

“After Cartagena,” she said. “After the hostel. Your plan.”

I told her about Medellín, about the museums I meant to see, about the coffee region I had circled on my map. I talked faster than I needed to. It was easier to plan my next moves than to think about the fact that my current room felt like it was tilting toward a wall.

Ana listened, then said, “You can always stay with me if you come to Valencia.”

I smiled at her. “That’s very kind.”

She nodded. “It’s easier to be brave when you are not alone.”

The wind picked up, rattling the shutters in the heritage wing. The sound came through the courtyard like a reminder. I tried to keep my face neutral. I could feel my jaw tighten.

After dinner, June went to edit photos and Ana went to call her boyfriend. I lingered in the courtyard and watched the clouds move. A few drops of rain fell and dried almost immediately, little dark freckles on the tile. I checked the weather on my phone. The advisory had moved from tropical depression to tropical storm watch, the arrow in the map pointing toward the coast like a finger. I took a screenshot. I considered posting it, then didn’t.

My phone buzzed with a message from my mother: How was today? Any more storms? I stared at the text longer than I should have. I wanted to write, It’s fine. I wanted to write, It’s worse than I’m admitting. I wrote, All good. Just humid. She replied with a single heart. It felt like a dot at the end of an argument.

When I finally went upstairs, the hallway to Historia was dark and damp. The strip of wood Carlos had nailed looked like a bandage on a patient who refused anesthesia. I ran my fingers along it. The wood was still rough, the nails not entirely flush. I felt a tiny splinter catch my skin. I pulled my hand away, annoyed at the tiny injury, and then at myself for being annoyed.

The door to my room stuck. It hadn’t before. I pulled it, and it moved a fraction, then stopped. The frame had swollen or shifted. I put my shoulder against it and pressed, and the door opened with a long, reluctant scrape. The sound echoed down the hallway like a complaint.

Inside, the room was dim, the light from the courtyard bulb filtered through the shutters in thin stripes. The beam above my bed looked darker, as if the wood had soaked up the day and was now giving it back slowly. The crack where the gecko had fallen was still there. It looked a little wider in the low light, or maybe that was just the shadow.

I changed into dry clothes and climbed into bed. The mosquito net hung limp, a pale curtain. I pulled it closed and listened.

The rain started softly, then harder, a tapping that became a steady, insistent beat. The building answered in small noises: a click here, a creak there, a sigh that could have been the wind or the beam settling. I held my breath without meaning to and then forced myself to let it out.

I told myself that all old buildings sounded like this. I told myself that in a different context, I would call it atmospheric. I told myself that I was lucky to have such a story. I told myself a lot of things.

Somewhere above my head, the wood made a small, dry pop. Not a crack, not a groan. A pop, like a knuckle being pulled.

I closed my eyes and waited to hear whether the next sound would be another pop or something worse.
