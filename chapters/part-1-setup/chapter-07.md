# Chapter 07: The Weather of Warnings

The hammering started before breakfast, a steady thud-thud-thud that made the ceiling flinch in time with it. I lay in bed and counted between strikes, telling myself it was a repair and not a drumbeat for a funeral.

The light in Historia always came in sideways, as if it were sneaking through the shutters rather than being invited. It made dust visible, every particle a tiny, indifferent asteroid. I watched the beam fall into the sunlight and thought, absurdly, that it looked like an old man's spine, bowed but still carrying on. I told myself that was poetic. I told myself I wasn't scared.

The hammering kept going.

I pulled the mosquito net aside and sat up. My feet met the floor at a slight angle, my toes touching tile that slanted toward the outer wall. The building didn't feel like a place so much as a habit. It had learned me as I had learned it: where the floor dipped, which board complained, which shutter stuck. That was comforting in a way I didn't want to admit. The point of traveling had been to be unsettled. I had, by accident, started to settle.

The hammering wasn't in my room. It was in the hallway, and then below that, where the heritage wing met the newer section. I found my glasses, wiped the fog from the lenses, and made my way out.

The hallway smelled of wet plaster and coffee. Marta was down on her knees with a bucket and a trowel, her hands moving in quick, sure strokes. A young man I hadn't seen before held a short ladder and hammered nails into a strip of wood that looked like it had been salvaged from a chair. He was sweating already, his shirt darker at the shoulders. Carlos stood behind him, arms folded, a clipboard tucked under one elbow like a shield.

He looked up when he saw me. His face did that tight smile it always did, the one that said he was being polite and that politeness had a cost. “Buenos días, Emma.”

“Is everything okay?” I asked, as if the hammering hadn't answered me.

Carlos glanced at the wall, then at the crack Marta was smoothing into the shape of not existing. “Just maintenance,” he said. “The storm left some… small issues.”

“Small issues,” I repeated, tasting it. It sounded like a phrase from a press release.

Marta made a little sound that was either a laugh or a cough. She didn't look up. Her trowel scraped the wall, and a thin drift of white dust fell to the floor like powdered sugar.

“We are making it beautiful again,” Carlos said. “As always.”

I nodded. “It’s already beautiful.”

Carlos's mouth twitched in a way that might have been gratitude. It might have been regret. “Beautiful and old,” he said. “We have to help it.”

I wanted to say that I could help, that I was happy to chip in, that I wasn't just a tourist consuming atmosphere. But I didn't have gloves, and I didn't speak enough Spanish to apologize properly, and I had never held a trowel in my life. I stood there, a girl with damp hair and a sense of herself as competent, and felt mildly ridiculous.

The young man paused and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. His eyes flicked to me, then away. There was a smudge of white on his cheek. He looked like someone fixing a museum after hours.

“Do you need to close the room?” I asked, because I knew I should. Because my mother would have asked. Because someone had to.

Carlos shook his head quickly. “No, no. Historia is fine. The room is fine. We are just… making sure. For the guests.”

There was a pause where I could have said I didn't mind moving, where I could have taken the out. Instead I said, “I can handle a little… character.”

Marta snorted, and it was definitely a laugh this time. She pressed her palm against the wet plaster and said something in Spanish that I didn't catch. Carlos answered her in the same low, quick tone, and she shook her head without looking up.

I smiled as if I understood. That was my specialty.

When I went back to my room, the hammering followed me like a heartbeat. I sat at the edge of the bed and opened my journal, but the words felt too slow for the sound. I pulled out my phone instead and took a photo of the hallway repairs, the ladder and the dust and Marta's hands. I wrote a caption in my head: Restoration as a form of care. The legacy of colonial architecture requires maintenance, not romance. It sounded like something I would post if I were braver.

I didn't post it. I didn't want anyone to reply with a joke about tetanus.

Instead I wrote in my journal: Woke up to the sound of repairs. The building is a patient and we are the doctors.

It was ridiculous, but it felt true, which is not the same thing.

Breakfast was bread and papaya again, the papaya still tasting faintly of soap no matter how much lime I squeezed on it. The courtyard had dried, the tiles clean and bright under the sun. The broken fountain had a new layer of leaves, each one a small, crisp boat. Someone had hung a strand of laundry across the courtyard, and a row of damp shirts waved like flags of exhaustion.

June was at the table with her camera, editing photos. Ana sat across from her, hair twisted up, a mug of coffee so black it looked like a hole. A French couple I hadn’t seen before were whispering over a map, their fingers tracing a route like a fortune.

I dropped into a chair and pulled my plate toward me. The bread was so dry it squeaked. I drizzled it with too much jam and pretended the sweetness was enough to make it breakfast.

June glanced up. “They’re patching,” she said.

“I saw,” I said. “Nothing major. Maintenance.”

“Mm.” She tapped her screen. “That’s what they called it at my old place in Melbourne when the balcony sagged.”

“Did it collapse?” I asked, trying to sound casual.

“No,” she said. “They propped it with a ladder for three months and then red-taped it. That’s how you know it’s serious.”

Ana smiled into her coffee. “A ladder is not a structure,” she said.

“It is in Australia,” June said.

We all laughed, but it wasn’t entirely a joke. The ladder in the hallway had been short and a little bent. I pictured it propping up the entire building, the way people prop up their belief in institutions: with whatever they have at hand.

I chewed the bread and scrolled through the news on my phone. The headline about the storm was already buried under celebrity gossip and a political scandal in the UK. The weather update for Cartagena mentioned another system off the coast, not a hurricane, just a tropical depression. I clicked, read two sentences, and closed it. Too early to worry, I told myself. Too early to write about. The fact that I was already assigning it a narrative slot annoyed me.

On the wall behind the reception desk, someone had taped up a flyer for a walking tour: COLONIAL CARTAGENA: BEAUTY AND BATTLE. Ten thousand pesos. Meet at the plaza at ten. I had done the street food tour. I had done the islands. I had, if I was being honest, been running out of things to do that felt like they mattered.

“I’m doing that tour,” I said, mostly to myself.

June looked up. “You know you could also, like, rest.”

“I have rested,” I said. “I am so rested I’m practically a corpse.”

Ana glanced at me, one eyebrow lifting. “Don’t say that in this building.”

“Sorry,” I said, and then added, “I will be a lively corpse.”

June snorted. “Go learn some colonial guilt. I'll come if you want.”

“I want,” I said, grateful not to be alone.

The guide met us under a bougainvillea arch that shed purple petals onto his hat. He introduced himself as Rafael and launched into a monologue in English so practiced it sounded like a recording. We followed him through the walled city, past facades as smooth as icing and balconies held up by white columns that looked too thin for their jobs.

Rafael talked about pirates, about the weight of gold, about the slaves who hauled stones and died in the heat. He gestured at a church and said the bell tower had been rebuilt twice because lightning loved it. He said that the walls had been repaired so many times that the original stones were now in the middle, like bones covered by muscle and fat. He said this with a smile, and I found myself wondering if he knew how much of his smile was expected.

We stopped in a small plaza where a building sat under scaffolding like a wounded arm. “Restoration,” Rafael said, his voice turning solemn. “This city is always restoring itself. There is a cycle. The sea eats, the rain softens, the money comes, the money goes.”

A man in a hard hat walked past carrying a bucket of mortar. He looked at the tourists, at our cameras and our sun hats, and kept walking.

“Is it dangerous?” someone asked. She was American, maybe, wearing a shirt that said LIVE LAUGH LIMA.

Rafael spread his hands. “The city is old,” he said. “The city is alive. We take care. We respect. But sometimes… sometimes she decides.” He tapped the wall beside him, a gentle knuckle rap that made the plaster tremble. “She is heavy.”

The group made the appropriate noises. I felt my stomach tighten, a small, involuntary clench that I told myself was empathy, not fear.

June leaned close to me. “You should ask if she decides often,” she whispered.

“I should not be that tourist,” I whispered back, and then, because I couldn't help myself, I asked Rafael when the last collapse had been.

He didn't miss a beat. “There was a balcony in Getsemaní three years ago,” he said. “No one was hurt. Another in the old city in the 90s, that one was worse. But they are rare.” He smiled again. “If you do not stand under a loose balcony in a storm, you are probably okay.”

I laughed on time with the group. I thought of my bed. I thought of the ceiling above it. I thought of the storm that had already come and gone and the hammering in the hallway. Probably okay. Probably.

After the tour, June and I walked to a small café near the wall. The air smelled like coffee and fried plantain, and the fan over the counter did more noise than cooling. We sat under a window that looked out at the city, the light sharp and white.

June ordered an iced coffee that came in a glass jar, because of course it did. I ordered agua de panela and pretended I wasn't wishing for a cappuccino. We both peeled the condensation off our cups with our fingers.

“I noticed you ask a lot of questions,” June said, a little teasing, a little not. “You’re a journalist?”

“Sort of,” I said. “I write. I'm… I’m going to university.”

“What for?”

“English. Maybe history.”

“Of course,” she said, and smiled. It was a kind smile, the kind that didn't make me feel small.

I watched a dog in the street chase a piece of bread. A man in a straw hat watched the dog with the same expression he would probably use for a political scandal: weary and unsurprised.

“Do you ever feel weird about it?” I asked, surprising myself.

“About what?”

“Being in places like this. It’s so beautiful and so… complicated.”

June stirred her coffee. “Yeah,” she said. “But I also feel weird about being in my own country. So. It’s mostly me.”

I laughed, relieved. “Same.”

She sipped, then added, “You can feel weird and still have a good time. That’s most of traveling.”

That felt like a quote I would put in my journal, but I didn't. I wanted it to stay hers.

We walked back along the wall, the heat thickening. On the corner near the market, we passed a row of houses with white paper notices taped to their doors. I slowed to read one. It was in Spanish, but the bolded word was clear: INSPECCIÓN. I didn't know if it was an inspection announcement or a warning. Either way, it made my shoulders tense.

A woman inside one of the houses was sweeping water out the door, her broom pushing a small river over the threshold. She looked up, saw me reading, and shook her head. “Mucho viejo,” she said. Too old. Her mouth twisted in a half-smile, half-grimace. Then she shrugged as if what could you do.

I nodded as if I understood. I did understand, I told myself. I understood that age was a fact and that beauty sometimes came with cracks. I understood that my fascination with “authenticity” was a kind of privilege. I understood that I was choosing this, which meant I could also choose differently. I just wasn't going to.

By the time we got back, the hostel smelled of bleach and cilantro. Someone was chopping onions in the kitchen, the sharpness making my eyes water. Carlos sat at the reception desk with a radio beside him, its voice crackling with Spanish that rolled too fast for me to parse. He scribbled something on a form and looked up as we passed.

“Later today there may be rain,” he said. “Just a little.”

June raised an eyebrow. “Another storm?”

“Not like before,” he said quickly. “Just afternoon rain.” He smiled. It was smaller than usual.

“I love afternoon rain,” I said, because it seemed like the right thing to say. Carlos nodded, and I felt like we were both performing.

---

In the afternoon, the heat thickened until it felt like a physical thing, like I was wading through it. The heritage wing held onto the warmth the way old wood holds onto smoke. I sat at my desk and tried to write, but the words came out like sweating: slow, messy, not as elegant as I wanted.

I kept thinking about Rafael tapping the wall, about the phrase she is heavy. I kept thinking about the notice that said INSPECCIÓN, about the way the woman had shrugged. I kept thinking about Carlos's quick smile when he said just a little rain. I kept thinking about the hammering and the ladder and the plaster dust on the floor.

I opened my journal and wrote: I am surrounded by history and also by rot. It feels like a metaphor and a warning at the same time.

Then I crossed out warning and wrote lesson. Then I crossed out lesson and wrote ambiance. I left it at that.

A gecko fell from the ceiling while I was writing, a small brown comet that landed on my bed with a soft thump and then skittered away under the mosquito net. I laughed out loud, surprised, and then remembered the first day I had found the gecko charming. It was still charming. It was also, apparently, falling through gaps. I glanced up and saw a hairline crack above the beam, a line so thin it could have been a shadow if the light hit it differently. I told myself it was a shadow.

The afternoon rain came hard and sudden, as it always did, a sheet of water that made the courtyard darken and the air smell like wet stone. I stood in my doorway and watched the fountain fill. The sound of the rain on the tiles was loud and soft at the same time, a steady hiss. For a moment, it was pleasant, a forced pause.

Then the building groaned.

It was a slow, deep sound, not the sharp pop from last night but something longer, like the building was exhaling. The wood above me shuddered. A few grains of plaster drifted from the ceiling and landed on my shoulder. I brushed them away and told myself the rain was just heavy. I told myself wood expands and contracts. I told myself that old buildings make noise, that this was part of the charm I had paid for.

In the courtyard below, someone whooped at the rain. It sounded like a party cheer. I felt the urge to go down and be social, to be in a space with other bodies, with noise. Instead I stayed where I was, watching the water, the hallway, the way the light flickered when the clouds passed over.

My phone buzzed. A text from my mother: Any more storms? Please say you're safe.

I stared at the message longer than I needed to. I typed: Just rain. All fine. The building is old but it's okay.

I hit send and immediately regretted the last sentence. It read like a reassurance you write when you are trying to convince yourself. I turned the phone face down on the desk, as if I could hide from it.

The rain lasted twenty minutes and then stopped as abruptly as it had begun. The city returned to its heat, the tiles steaming. The smell of rain lingered, sweet and earthy. The groan in the building faded. I told myself that was evidence.

At five, I went down to the courtyard. A few guests were sitting in the hammocks, their feet swinging. A man with a laptop and no shirt was using the Wi-Fi from the broken fountain, his screen reflecting the sky. Ana was there, peeling a mango with a small knife, the skin curling away in one continuous strip.

“You look thoughtful,” she said, holding out a slice.

“More like paranoid,” I said, and accepted it. The mango tasted like sunlight and sugar and relief.

“What happened?”

“Nothing,” I said. “Just… the building makes noises.”

Ana nodded. “It has many bones. Bones creak.”

“Do you believe in bones?” I asked, and felt stupid as soon as the words left me.

She smiled. “I believe in gravity. I believe in time. They are like bones.”

I laughed, because it was funny and because it wasn't. “Are you moving rooms?” I asked her, because if she said yes, then I could use her decision as evidence.

“I moved this morning,” she said. “Seguro. I want to sleep.”

“And you couldn’t sleep here?”

She hesitated. “I could,” she said. “But I don't need to.”

I picked at the mango with my teeth. The juice ran down my wrist. “I don’t know if I can sleep there,” I said, then realized what I had said. I meant in the new wing. I meant in the normal room without history in the walls. I meant in a bed that felt like any other bed. I felt ridiculous for admitting it.

Ana's expression softened. “You can sleep anywhere,” she said. “You just don't want to.”

“Maybe,” I said. “Maybe that’s the same thing.”

We sat in silence for a moment, the courtyard full of damp heat. The sky was a bruised gray, a hint that the rain might return. The air smelled like wet leaves and cleaning solution.

Carlos stepped into the courtyard and cleared his throat. He had a small stack of papers in his hand, damp at the edges. “Friends,” he said. “We will close the heritage wing for cleaning tonight. Just for the night. The humidity, you understand.”

A few heads turned. A few people shrugged. I felt my chest tighten.

“I’m in Historia,” I said, though he already knew.

“Yes,” he said. “We can move you to Seguro. Same price. It is more—” He searched for the word. “Dry.”

I looked at the paper in his hand. It was a list of room numbers, written in neat columns. There were empty spaces where he could write names. I felt the weight of the choice like a hand on my shoulder.

“I’m fine where I am,” I said.

Carlos's mouth did the tight thing again. “It is not a big problem,” he said. “But there is a little… wet.”

“I have a towel,” I said, and smiled. It was my most charming smile, the one I had learned in debating society when I wanted to win without sounding like I wanted to win. It worked on judges. It worked on teachers. It did not, I could tell, work on Carlos.

Ana said nothing. June, on the other side of the courtyard, lifted her eyebrows at me. I shrugged, as if the decision were casual.

“Okay,” Carlos said. He made a note on his list and walked away.

The relief I felt was immediate and embarrassing. The decision was made, and with it the fantasy of myself as a person who could choose safety over story collapsed. I wanted to feel proud of my commitment to authenticity. I mostly felt stubborn.

That night, the humidity pressed against the walls like a hand. The room smelled of damp wood and cheap detergent. The sheets were clean, but they never felt dry. I lay on my back and listened to the building settle, to the occasional click of gecko feet, to the slow drip of water somewhere in the walls.

I had read for an hour, the words in One Hundred Years of Solitude blurring into the sound of rain beginning again. It was not hard rain, just a soft, persistent tapping on the shutters. The wind came in small gusts, making the wooden slats rattle. I loved the sound, I told myself. I loved the way it sounded like a house speaking.

I checked my phone. No new messages. I scrolled through Instagram and saw that my morning post had gotten twenty-six likes. One comment: “So jealous! That building looks insane.” I stared at the word insane and wondered if it could be a compliment and a warning at once.

I opened my notes and typed a caption for a photo I hadn't taken yet: The rain here doesn’t fall; it arrives, like a visitor who doesn’t take off his shoes. I added a line about humidity as history and then deleted it. It all felt too neat.

The room creaked again, a long, slow complaint. I listened, trying to locate it. The sound seemed to come from the beam above me, then from the wall, then from the floor. It was impossible to tell. The building was a chorus.

I wanted to call my mother. I wanted to say, “I think I should move.” I wanted to hear her say, “Yes.” I also wanted to say, “I’m okay,” and have her believe it. I did neither. I put the phone away and pulled the mosquito net closed, the mesh whispering against my hands.

The light from the courtyard lamp made the net glow a faint gold. The shadows of the beams cut it into rectangles. I lay there and tried to breathe evenly, to make my chest rise and fall in a way that did not draw attention to itself.

The rain grew heavier, still not a storm but insistent, as if it were testing the roof. I thought of the afternoon's quick downpour, the groan. I thought of Rafael saying the city was heavy. I thought of the woman sweeping water from her doorway. I thought of Carlos telling me it was just a little wet. I thought of my own text to my mother: The building is old but it's okay.

I was halfway to sleep when I heard it: a sharper crack, a sound like a branch snapping, low and close. My eyes snapped open. I sat up, heart thudding, and listened. Silence followed, thick and rude. I waited for another sound. None came.

In the gap between one heartbeat and the next, I decided the sound had been the shutter in the wind. I decided the sound had been in another room. I decided it had been nothing. I lay back down and pulled the net tighter.

Outside, the rain fell with a soft determination. Inside, the building held its breath. I tried to do the same.
