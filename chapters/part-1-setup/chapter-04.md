# Chapter 04: The Sound of Settling

The power flickered once, twice, and then held, like the building was blinking in slow motion and deciding it wanted to keep seeing me.

I laughed, because when you are nineteen in a colonial room with rain rattling the shutters, the choices are laugh or leave, and I had made a commitment to not leaving. The bulb steadied, throwing a harsh yellow circle across the mosquito net and the floor. Everything inside the light looked calm and staged. Everything outside it looked like a shadowed stage set that could move if it wanted to.

I had my phone out already, because I was a coward to the gods of content. The weather alert was still on the screen, its block capitals and cheerful icon making the storm feel like a theme park ride. I took a screenshot. I told myself I would write a caption about imperial architecture and climate change and the way history and weather both return no matter how much you pretend you are in control. I would be thoughtful. I would be real. I would be alive.

The wind shoved the shutters again, hard enough that the wooden slats rattled in their frame and the towel I had stuffed into the gap flopped like a small surrender flag. I pressed my palm against the wall and felt the vibration. It was alive, in a way. It was also old. The worst kind of alive.

---

I decided to shower before the water stopped working. It felt like a practical decision, which is what I told myself whenever I did something that was mostly about comfort. The hallway outside Historia was darker than usual, the light from the courtyard a weak pulse, the shadows thick in the corners where the plaster had crumbled away. The air was cooler here, damp and metallic, the smell of wet adobe and old wood rising from the floor.

I passed the waiver sign on the wall and slowed. The paper had curled at the edges, the tape yellowed. The words were in Spanish and English, a list of gentle warnings dressed up as legal protection. I could read them all if I stopped. I didn't. I wasn't the kind of tourist who fixated on liability. I was the kind of tourist who trusted her choices.

At the end of the hallway, the bathroom door stuck, so I shouldered it open. The mirror was fogged, the small crack in the corner now a thin river of condensation. The shower coughed and then ran, cold, then hot, then colder than before. I stepped in anyway. The water hit my scalp with the force of a minor confession. I stood there and listened to the storm through the tiny window, the rain a relentless hiss.

When I shut off the water, the lights flickered. In the mirror, my hair was a dark slick against my neck. I looked younger without my glasses, the way I did when I wanted to pretend I wasn't still a child. I put the glasses back on because I wanted to see.

The door creaked as I opened it. Ana was in the hallway, barefoot, holding a towel and looking toward the staircase. Her hair was damp, her expression thoughtful.

"You okay?" I asked, because the question was easy.

She shrugged. "It is just rain. But old buildings, they always sound like they are alive. It makes me nervous."

"I like it," I said. "It feels historic. Liminal." I heard myself use the word and wanted to be embarrassed by it, but she only smiled.

"Liminal," she repeated, the syllables tasting like someone else's language. "We use another word. We say the house is tired."

"I wrote that yesterday," I said, and then felt ridiculous for admitting I wrote anything about a building to a stranger.

She laughed. "Then you should sleep somewhere that is rested."

Before I could answer, a man appeared at the far end of the hall. He was older, with a thick mustache and a plastic poncho, a local guest or maybe a worker from the street who had rented a bed for the night. He saw Ana, nodded, and then his gaze flicked past us to the doorway of Historia. He stopped, made a low sound under his breath, and turned away.

"He won't go in there," Ana said quietly. "No one local does."

"Why not?" I asked, already knowing the answer I would give myself.

She lifted her shoulders. "They know the building. They grew up with it. They know which parts are safe." She said safe in a way that made it feel like a location rather than a condition.

I wanted to ask which parts were safe. I didn't, because I didn't want to hear the answer. If the older man wouldn't step inside my hallway, then my room was already part of a story I didn't want to be in.

The lights flickered again. In the dimness, Ana's face looked paler, more serious. "You can always move," she said, as if she could read the argument in my head. "Seguro is fine. It is not as pretty, but you can still sleep."

"I booked Historia," I said. "It's the whole point." The words came out sharper than I intended.

She nodded, not offended. "It is your trip."

I heard the rain hammering the roof and felt the stubbornness in my chest stiffen like a spine. I wanted to be the kind of person who did not change plans because of weather or superstition. I wanted to be the kind of person who could explain the building's sounds in rational terms. I wanted to be interesting. I wanted to be safe. The wants sat together in my gut and did not resolve.

"Thanks," I said. "Really."

She smiled and walked toward the modern wing. I watched her go, then turned back toward my room. The hallway narrowed, the air thickened. I could hear the storm louder now, or maybe I was just listening harder.

In the room, the towel on the shutter gap was damp. I pressed it tighter, like I was sealing a leak in a ship. My phone buzzed with a notification: a follower commenting on my storm screenshot, asking if I was safe. I typed, Safe. Very atmospheric. and then deleted atmospheric because it felt like a word that could be used in court. I wrote Safe. Just rain. instead.

The message posted. I watched the little heart appear, that tiny proof of attention. I felt a sharp, petty thrill and then a smaller, quieter shame. The building creaked, as if to clear its throat.

---

By seven the courtyard had flooded. Not in a catastrophic way, just in the slow, unglamorous way of water finding its path across cracked tiles and insisting on it. The broken fountain overflowed with rainwater and made a pool that reflected the single Wi-Fi bulb, so it looked like there was a second light beneath the floor.

Most of the guests had drifted inside. The air in the common room was thick with damp clothes and the smell of wet canvas. A French couple were drinking rum out of plastic cups. Two Australians were trying to play cards and failing because the table wobbled. The British guy with the beard was explaining, for the third time, that tropical storms were nothing compared to a proper English winter.

I sat in the corner with my journal and the polite posture of someone who wanted to be seen as interesting but not interrupted. The rain pounded the roof above us, a steady roar that made the room feel smaller. It was hard to hear people without leaning in, which meant everyone ended up closer than they would have chosen.

Carlos came in from the courtyard with his sleeves rolled up. His hair was damp, plastered to his forehead. He carried a bucket and a mop like he was fighting the water with blunt tools.

"Do you need help?" I asked, because I wanted to be the kind of traveler who offered. I did not move.

"No, no. You are a guest," he said. He smiled with tired eyes. "Just stay away from the windows. The wind is strong tonight. These old shutters, they do what they want."

"They are charming," I said, and immediately hated myself for saying it out loud.

He looked at me for a second. "Charming is a good word for danger you choose," he said, and then he gave a short laugh, the kind that leaves room for apology if it lands wrong. "Sorry. I am joking." He dipped the mop into the bucket and moved on.

I sat back and let my cheeks cool. Carlos had that way of speaking that made everything sound both like advice and like a warning. I wanted to tell him I could handle it, because I wanted him to believe that I was the kind of person who could handle it. Instead I nodded like we had shared a joke.

At the edge of the room, Marta stood in the doorway, looking in but not entering. The room was loud, but she was still. She watched the ceiling more than the people. When she noticed me looking, she nodded and then crossed herself, as if there was a saint for storms and she had already learned his name.

I tried to do a mental inventory of saints I knew. It was not a long list. Saints did not make the travel blogs.

The rain shifted, heavier now. The building made a low sound, a groan that ran through the beams like a throat clearing. It was deep enough that you felt it in your chest before you heard it in your ears. The Australians paused their game. The French couple lifted their cups and waited. A trickle of plaster dust shook loose and drifted down like a soft snow. It landed on the bar and the bartender wiped it away without comment.

"Just the weather," someone said, with the easy confidence of a person who had never needed a waiver to sleep.

I looked at my journal and wrote: The sound of settling can be mistaken for the sound of breathing. I underlined settling and then wondered if that was too on the nose. I left it anyway.

When the power flickered again, a chorus of groans went up, half in frustration, half in performative fear. Someone said, "Imagine if the roof fell in," and everyone laughed, because horror is always funny when you think it will stop at the punchline.

I laughed too.

The British guy with the beard leaned toward me, lowering his voice as if we were co-conspirators. "Had a mate in Prague," he said. "Ceiling fell right onto his bunk. He slept through it. Woke up with plaster in his hair and a story. They're all fine." He said fine in a way that made it sound like a currency.

"That's reassuring," I said, and meant the opposite. I wanted to tell him that Prague didn't have hurricane season, that this building was older than his country in its current shape, that the difference between a story and a tragedy was a hinge of timing. Instead I nodded, because if you say too much in a hostel common room you either sound dramatic or boring, and I didn't want to be either.

"You in the old wing?" he asked.

I hesitated just long enough to be honest. "Historia."

"Ah," he said, and took a sip of rum. "Very authentic."

He said it like a compliment and a warning at the same time. The word authentic fluttered between us like a moth. I swatted it away in my head and made a note to use it in a caption later, because why waste a good word.

The rain hit the windows harder. A gust forced a window open a crack, and the bartender had to shove it shut with her hip. The room cheered when it clicked back into place, because we were all a little drunk on the idea of survivable danger. I watched water snake across the floor toward the drain, a slow, lazy river that made the tiles look slick and old.

My phone buzzed again. A DM from a friend back home: "So like, are you okay in a storm in Colombia???" I stared at the message for a moment, then replied with a photo of the courtyard and a line about "embracing the elements." It sounded poetic. It also sounded like something that would be read out loud in a courtroom someday.

Carlos passed by again, this time carrying a flashlight and a bundle of candles. The sight of the candles made the storm feel real in a way that the rain hadn't. I followed him with my eyes until he disappeared into the hallway toward the modern wing. I imagined him checking rooms, making sure everyone had light, making sure the building was behaving. I wondered if he would check on me. I wondered if I would accept it if he did.

The bartender turned up the radio, trying to drown out the storm with salsa. It did not work. The music tangled with the rain and made a new kind of noise, festive and panicked at the same time.

I excused myself and headed back upstairs before the sky could decide to do something worse. The staircase to the heritage wing was slick at the edges, damp from people tracking water. Each step dipped under my weight with a soft complaint. I held the handrail, warm and worn, and climbed slowly, counting the steps like I was counting safety.

---

Back in Historia, the room felt smaller. The humidity had thickened the air into something you could almost chew. The mosquito nets hung limp and heavy. The floor had a sheen of damp, and my sandals stuck to it when I moved. The shutters rattled every time the wind hit, a clack-clack that felt like a bad metronome. I shoved a second towel into the gap and felt ridiculous for believing I could improve the physics of a 400-year-old window with a hostel towel.

I pulled my mattress slightly away from the wall, a few inches, because the wall was damp and because moving furniture was a kind of superstition. The metal legs scraped on the tile. The bed sank a fraction, then settled. The movement made the frame shiver. The beam above my head seemed to watch.

I took a photo of the room, not because it looked good, but because if you are going to do something stupid you might as well document it. The photo came out blurry, the light too yellow, the ceiling too low. It looked less romantic than I wanted it to. It looked like what it was.

I opened my phone and drafted a caption: Riding out a tropical storm in a 17th-century room is a lesson in humility. I deleted lesson in humility and replaced it with lesson in history. I deleted history too, because it sounded like a History Channel special. I saved the draft anyway.

The rain got louder. The sound on the roof was a constant roar, a thousand hands drumming. The wind came in pulses, each one hitting the shutters with enough force to make the bed vibrate. I could feel the vibration in my ankles. I told myself it was just the wind. I told myself that the building had weathered centuries of storms, and this was just another one.

That thought comforted me. It was also a lie I was actively choosing to believe.

I lay down and tried to imagine explaining this night to my future self. I could see her, older and better at packing, reading a journal entry that made the storm sound romantic rather than damp and loud. I pictured myself writing about the way the rain made the streets shine and the way the building's beams seemed to hum like old strings. I pictured the story in a box, labeled: THIS IS WHY I TRAVEL. It was a comforting frame, a way to turn fear into narrative.

The problem was that the story I was actually in did not feel neat. It felt sticky, like wet clothes. It felt like something I might later pretend was brave. I hated that about myself. I also loved it. The part of me that wanted to be special was always negotiating with the part of me that wanted to be safe, and the negotiation never finished. It just held on, like the shutters holding against the wind.

I thought about my father, the way he used to point out flaws in buildings like they were jokes. He once made us stop by a church in our town because, according to him, "the roof is doing something stupid." I had been thirteen, bored, and he had dragged me inside and made me look up at a beam that was bowing in the middle. "It will hold," he had said, "but I wouldn't sit under it for long." I had rolled my eyes. I had sat under it for half an hour to prove a point. It had not fallen. I had felt smug.

Now, lying under a bowing beam in a city I barely knew, I wondered if smugness had a shelf life.

My phone buzzed again. I ignored it. The light on the screen would have made the room look too small. The sound of the storm was enough company.

The gecko that had been my quiet roommate appeared on the wall above my bed. It clung there, watching me with its stupid, lidless eyes. I stared back. I wanted to ask it if it could feel the building shifting, if it knew which sounds meant danger and which were just the house speaking in its sleep. The gecko did not answer. It never did. It blinked, and then scurried into a crack near the beam.

"Coward," I said, which was unfair. It was a gecko. It had better instincts than me.

My phone buzzed. A message from my mother: How is the storm? Are you safe? Please move if you feel unsafe.

I stared at the message. I pictured her in Surrey, watching the news and imagining palm trees bending like paper. I pictured her telling my father, him making a noise in his throat and then looking up a flight schedule. I typed, Safe. Just noisy. and then, because I always wanted to be the daughter who made her mother laugh, I added a smiley face.

She responded with a thumbs-up emoji and the word Love. I responded with Love too, because I did love her. I just didn't want that love to feel like a tether.

The room was too loud to read. I lay on my back and stared at the ceiling. The crack along the beam looked darker now, damp with rain. Water had found its way through the plaster and was running along the crack like ink. A drop formed, swelled, and fell, landing on my sheet with a small, rude plop. I moved my pillow out of its path and told myself I had solved the problem.

The gecko that had been my quiet roommate appeared on the wall above my bed. It clung there, watching me with its stupid, lidless eyes. I stared back. I wanted to ask it if it could feel the building shifting, if it knew which sounds meant danger and which were just the house speaking in its sleep. The gecko did not answer. It never did. It blinked, and then scurried into a crack near the beam.

"Coward," I said, which was unfair. It was a gecko. It had better instincts than me.

Somewhere in the hallway, a door slammed. The sound was swallowed quickly by the rain. I sat up and listened. The heritage wing was quiet otherwise. The room felt too large for my body, too full of empty beds. I could have gone downstairs to sit with the others, but I didn't want to be the girl who ran from her own narrative. I wanted to be the girl who stayed.

I opened my journal and tried to write. The words came slower than usual, like the damp had gotten into my sentences.

I wrote about the storm, about the way the wind made the shutters shake and the floor vibrate. I wrote about the smell of wet adobe, the way it was earthy and sharp, like a garden turned inside out. I wrote about the building as a body again, because I couldn't stop myself. I wrote: It is not groaning because it is old; it is groaning because it is holding.

I underlined holding, and then I regretted it. Underlining something does not make it less true.

The light flickered again. I froze, pen in hand, listening to the hum of the ceiling bulb. The sound of electricity in old wiring is a tiny hiss, like a whisper you can't quite catch. The bulb steadied. The rain did not.

A crack sounded from somewhere above the ceiling. It was sharp and close, like a stick snapping in the woods. My breath stopped. The sound was followed by a low, long groan, a slow settling that ran along the beam like a sigh. The bed frame shivered. Dust fell in a soft cascade, landing in my hair and on my journal.

I sat very still. I waited for another crack. I waited for the sound of running feet, for Carlos or Ana or anyone to come to the door. Nothing happened. The room held its breath again.

I let mine out.

"It is just the storm," I said, out loud, to no one. The words tasted like cheap reassurance. I said them again anyway. "Old buildings make noise. That's normal."

I could hear the words from the warning checklist in my head, as if I had read it on the waiver: STRUCTURAL MOVEMENT MAY OCCUR. GUESTS ASSUME ALL RISK. The ink in my signature had felt like nothing when I wrote it.

The bed was warmer now, my skin damp. I lay back down and pulled the mosquito net closed around me, as if mesh could keep out gravity. The fabric brushed my face. It smelled like bleach and rain.

The storm outside kept pushing. The building answered in small sounds. I listened to both until they blurred together into one long, animal noise, and in that noise I heard, faintly, the same thing my mother had said: If it feels unsafe, you move.

I did not move.

I counted my breaths, partly to calm myself, partly to prove I was fine. I listed the reasons to stay the way I listed pros and cons in my head: I had paid for Historia. The photos would look better. Leaving would mean admitting I had been wrong about something I had already posted. It was silly, but it was also true. My pride sat on the edge of the bed with me, a neat, prim little companion. It said, You wanted authenticity. This is what it sounds like. I let it talk because it was easier than arguing.

At some point, the power went out for real. The bulb died. The room went black. The rain was louder without the light. I lay in the darkness and tried to picture the beams above me, their old wood soft and pitted, the termites that had made tunnels through them, the weight they had carried for so long. I told myself that history was strong. I told myself that stories held buildings up.

Another crack sounded, closer this time. The bed shifted, a tiny roll toward the outer wall. The mosquito net swayed like a slow pendulum.

I held my breath and listened.

The building settled, and then the storm pushed again.

Somewhere above my head, something gave a small, tired sigh, and the darkness answered it with a soft, dry rain of dust.

I stayed very still, waiting to hear whether the next sound would be another sigh or something else entirely.
