# Chapter 03: The Weight of Light

I woke with plaster dust on my lips, which is a sentence that makes me sound like I had slept under a crumbling museum. It was worse, in a way: I had slept in a cheap bed under a ceiling I had decided was historic rather than precarious. The dust tasted faintly of chalk and old paper, like a library that had been left in the rain. I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand and sat up, careful, as if my movement could offend the beams.

The room was damp and still. The mosquito net hung over my bunk like gauze over a wound. The fan on the wall was off. I could hear the courtyard below waking in small, human noises: a clatter of a kettle, the squeak of a mop, a soft Spanish argument about coffee. Outside the shutters, the light was pale and humid, already thick with heat.

When I pulled the net aside, a tiny cascade of dust fell from the seam where the wall met the ceiling. It landed on my sheets and made a constellation of powder. The line in the plaster looked a little darker than it had the night before. That could have been the light. It could have been my new obsession. It could have been that the building, like a person, looked worse in the morning.

I reached for my journal instead of my phone. That was intentional, I told myself. I was here to be present. I was here to learn about colonialism, not refresh Instagram.

The first sentence I wrote was: The house is a body, and the body remembers everything.

It was exactly the sort of thing I would roll my eyes at if I saw it on someone else's caption. I underlined remembers anyway.

The courtyard smelled like coffee and mildew and the sweet, rotting edge of fruit. A bowl of bananas sat on the table like an offering. I poured myself a mug of coffee from a metal pot that burned my fingers and sat at the plastic table under the one spot of Wi-Fi, because authenticity only goes so far when you need to check your bank balance.

A German couple were debating whether to go to the mud volcano or the Rosario Islands. A Canadian girl in a linen romper was FaceTiming someone about how she had seen "a literal tarantula" in her room. An older man with a beard and a sunhat was reading a Spanish newspaper and frowning at it like it had personally offended him.

Carlos moved through the courtyard carrying a stack of linens, his shoulders slumped. He looked older in daylight. He caught me watching him and offered a smile that did not quite land.

"Morning," he said.

"Morning," I said, and held up my mug. "Is the coffee strong or dangerous?"

"Both," he said. "But you are alive, so it is good." He nodded toward my journal. "You write?"

"I'm trying," I said. "It's part of the gap year project. A sort of... record. For Cambridge." The word Cambridge did a lot of heavy lifting. It made me feel like I had a reason to be here beyond wanting to be interesting.

Carlos set the linens down and leaned on the table. "You are in Historia. How is it?"

I had a thousand answers, most of them conflicting. It was beautiful. It was damp. It was a museum. It was a trap. It was mine. I chose the easiest.

"It's incredible," I said. "The beams. The light. It feels like sleeping in a document."

He smiled with half his mouth. "Yes. It is... a document. Be careful with the shutters. They stick. And if you need another fan, we have maybe one." He sounded like he was thinking about other things, like maybe the cost of fans or the weight of ceilings.

"I'm fine," I said, too quickly.

Carlos nodded and picked up the linens again. Before he left, he added, "If you want to move to Seguro, it is quieter. But the Wi-Fi is worse. Up to you."

I laughed, trying to make it a joke. "I came for the creaks. They make it feel alive."

His smile tightened. "Alive, yes." He hesitated, then added, "There is a weather advisory for later today. Maybe some rain. Just be aware." He tapped the table, then moved on.

I watched him go, his steps measured as if he was listening for the building's mood. I told myself he was just being conscientious. Good hostel management, I thought. Safety talk for the tourists. It felt flattering, in a way, to be advised. It made me feel cared for without having to accept that I might need care.

My phone buzzed with a notification: a comment on my last post. A girl from school had written, "omg this looks SO aesthetic." I stared at it, then typed a response about the building's history and the legacy of colonialism, and then deleted it because it felt like a lecture. I sent a heart emoji instead. It was easier.

Across the courtyard, Marta crossed with her mop and bucket. She stopped at the threshold of the heritage hallway like a cat refusing a puddle. She made the sign of the cross, a quick flick of fingers, and then took the long way around.

I pretended not to see.

The morning swelled with heat. The air felt thick, as if the city were breathing in. I walked toward the walled city with my journal and my phone, because I didn't trust myself to exist without documentation. The streets were narrow and bright, a maze of white walls and colored doors. Bougainvillea spilled from balconies like controlled fires. A man on a bicycle balanced a stack of avocados on his head as if it were the easiest thing in the world.

I stopped at a plaza and sat on a low wall to write. The wall was warm from the sun. I could hear church bells marking the hours, and the sound bounced off the stone in a way that made it feel like time had a body. I wrote about the way the colonial buildings threw shade and the way the shade felt like privilege. I wrote about how the city sold its history as a product and how I was buying it with cash I hadn't earned. I wrote about the beauty of the blue shutters and then crossed out the word beauty because it felt too easy.

A tour group passed by, their guide holding a tiny yellow umbrella and explaining, in English, that the walls around the city had been built to keep pirates out. I pictured pirates and thought about how tourism is just a different kind of invasion.

I took a photo of a balcony with peeling paint and a perfectly arranged pot of flowers. I framed it so you couldn't see the electrical wire running across the sky like a scar. I opened the editing tool, considered a filter, then closed it. Authenticity, I reminded myself, was the point.

At a corner, a woman was selling arepas from a cart that smoked like incense. I bought one and burned my tongue on the first bite. It tasted like corn and salt and everything I wanted travel to be: simple and indulgent and a little painful. I ate standing in the shade, watching a boy chase a pigeon across the plaza with the seriousness of a military campaign.

By noon, the clouds had started to gather. The heat grew quieter, the light flattening. A low rumble rolled through the air, not thunder yet, but its cousin. Cartagena always felt theatrical, and even the weather seemed to perform.

I went back to the hostel for water and a shower, the humidity pressed against my skin like a wet towel. The heritage wing smelled stronger in the afternoon, the dampness rising from the adobe. The hallway narrowed and the light dimmed. When I opened the door to Historia, the room felt like it was holding its breath.

The beam above my bed looked the same, I told myself. I took another photo anyway. The crack beside it was a hairline, a thin pencil mark. I zoomed in on my phone until the pixels turned into a blur. That was proof, of a sort. I liked proof. It made me feel analytical rather than anxious.

In the bathroom, the mirror was cracked at the corner, a small vein of silver that split the glass. The faucet dripped. The shower was cold for thirty seconds and then scalding, and there was no middle ground. I stood under the water and let it run over my scalp, my hair heavy, my skin goose-bumped. The steam smelled like damp stone and something metallic. I told myself that this was part of the charm.

When I came back to my room, a gecko clung to the wall above my bed. It blinked at me like an old, indifferent deity. I took a photo. He didn't move. The building was full of tiny, quiet witnesses.

By early afternoon, the heat had turned the courtyard into a slow cooker. People moved like they were underwater. I filled my bottle from the kitchen tap and watched the water come out with a faint rust-colored first spurt before it ran clear. The tap in my house back home would have had a filter and a warning label. Here, it had neither, which felt honest, in a way. I drank anyway.

The kitchen was a tangle of smells: frying oil, garlic, the sour edge of someone else's leftovers. A Spanish woman I had seen around the courtyard was chopping tomatoes at the counter with a blunt knife. She looked up when I entered and smiled with the kind of warmth you can't fake.

"Hola," she said. "You are Emma, yes?"

"Yeah," I said. "Emma. You are...?"

"Ana," she said. "From Valencia. I heard you in the courtyard." She nodded toward my journal. "You write everything."

"It's a habit," I said.

"I am trying to teach myself to not write," she said, and laughed. She gestured with the knife at the counter. "You want some? I make too much."

I did not want to be in the kitchen, because kitchens make you socialize, and I was tired of performing my gap year. But I wanted to be the kind of person who accepted food from strangers and felt it was a meaningful cultural exchange. I said yes.

We ate standing by the sink, our plates balanced on the counter like a compromise. The tomatoes were sharp and sweet. The eggs were a little undercooked, which made them taste more alive.

"Where are you staying?" Ana asked.

"Historia," I said, and tried to make it sound casual.

"Oh," she said, and her expression did a small, quick shift. Not a frown. Not a smile. Something in between. "The old wing. It is... dramatic."

"I love it," I said.

She laughed. "You love it now. At night, it feels like the building is talking."

"That's the point," I said.

Ana lifted her shoulders in a shrug. "We all choose our haunted houses." She wiped the counter with her elbow, then asked, "You go out tonight?"

"Maybe," I said. "Storm coming, apparently."

"Ah," she said, and made a face. "Rain is fine. Wind is not."

I filed that away as weather advice, not as prophecy.

When I left the kitchen, I passed the notice board near reception. A weather advisory had been posted in Spanish, the paper curled at the corners. A cartoon cloud with lightning bolts smiled from the top. It looked so cheerful it was almost disrespectful. I snapped a photo of the notice, more as a joke than anything else, and then headed back to the courtyard to find a spot with Wi-Fi.

The Wi-Fi spot was under the one functioning bulb, a glowing insect lamp. I opened my laptop and tried to respond to emails, but the connection cut out every time I started a sentence. My mother had texted a link to an article titled HISTORIC BUILDING COLLAPSES IN LATIN AMERICA. I left it unopened, because I didn't want to feel like I was being watched by a future I didn't want to read.

To feel productive, I edited my photos instead. I adjusted the colors on the balcony shot until the blue was more honest. I typed a caption about architecture and memory, then deleted it. I scrolled and saw the photo of the beam from the night before. The sag looked more pronounced in the image than it did in real life. That was probably the wide-angle lens. That was probably my tendency to dramatize. I posted it anyway with the line I'd already rehearsed: 400 years of stories in these walls. Sometimes authenticity means accepting imperfection.

Within minutes, there were comments. Fire emojis. A friend from school wrote, "This is so you." Another wrote, "Looks spooky." I liked them all, because liking things is easier than responding.

I closed my laptop and lay back in a hammock, because if the Wi-Fi was going to fail me, I might as well pretend that was the plan. The hammock sagged and swayed. I could see the second-floor balcony above me, the hand-carved wooden balustrades dark with age. Someone had carved initials into one of the posts long ago; the letters were so worn you could barely make them out. I wondered who had done it, and if they were dead. It felt morbid and romantic at the same time.

The hammock creaked, and for a second I thought it was the building. I listened to the sound travel up through the ropes into the beams, and I liked the idea that I was tied into this structure, this place. I was part of its story, even if only for three nights.

When I stood up, the courtyard tiles were warm under my feet. A thin line of plaster dust lay near the doorway to the heritage wing, freshly fallen. I brushed my sandal across it and watched it scatter. It made no difference. It made me feel like I had done something.

Back in Historia, the room smelled like warm dust. The mosquito net over my bed had come untied at one corner and was hanging low. I retied it with a bow that felt absurdly delicate. The ceiling crack looked the same. I told myself that meant stability, as if a crack staying the same could be evidence of safety.

I sat on the bed and wrote another line in my journal: The building asks for attention, and I give it. It felt true.

---
By late afternoon, the courtyard had filled again. The air smelled like wet stone and brewing coffee. The Wi-Fi spot was crowded, everyone with their phones up like offerings. I sat at the edge of the table and called my mother, because I was tired of being brave in silence.

"Hi," she said. "You look hot. Are you eating properly?"

"I'm eating," I said. I was holding a bottle of water that had gone lukewarm. "It's just... really humid. Everything feels damp. Even my hair is damp. My soul is damp."

She laughed. "That's the tropics. Are you still in that old building?"

"Yes," I said, and then, because I couldn't stop myself, I added, "It's sort of incredible. The beams are from 1624."

"Emma," she said, and my full name sat heavy in her mouth. "Old buildings fall down. That's why we don't live in castles."

"We do live in castles," I said, because I wanted to win the argument on a technicality. "Most of Surrey is just castles with central heating."

"You know what I mean." She lowered her voice. "If it feels unsafe, you move. Promise me that."

"It feels fine," I said. There was a pause where we both held our words. In the background, someone dropped a plate, and the sound was sharp in the courtyard. I flinched.

"I just worry," she said, and then added, softer, "I know you want to be independent. I'm proud of you. Just... don't prove it by being reckless." She said reckless the way she said dessert, with equal parts warning and desire.

"I'm not reckless," I said. I could hear the defensiveness in my own voice and hated it. "I'm just... trying to do this properly."

"Properly is staying alive," she said.

We hung up with the usual I love you, the call ending before either of us could say the other thing we were thinking. I looked at my phone and saw a message from my brother: Hope you brought a hard hat. I considered responding and decided to let him worry. It felt like leverage.

I went inside the common room because it was cooler there. Someone had left the door open, and the air was moving, slow and damp. A travel poster on the wall advertised a sunset boat tour with a smiling couple who looked like they had never sweated. I picked up the brochure for a day trip to the Rosario Islands and then put it down because the hostel offered it at a discount and I didn't want to be like everyone else.

A British guy with tattoos was explaining to a French girl that colonialism was basically the same as capitalism. I listened for a moment and decided to retreat to the courtyard. There are only so many versions of that conversation I can tolerate.

Carlos was in the courtyard now, securing the hammocks with extra rope. He lifted the broken fountain's plastic cover and tied it down. It was the kind of small prep that made something feel real.

"Is the storm coming?" I asked.

"Maybe," he said. "They say tropical storm. It will be rain, maybe wind. Nothing too bad. But the city is old. Things move. We watch." He said it calmly, the way you might describe a temperamental pet.

"I kind of want to hear it," I said. "The storm. In a building like this. It's dramatic." I tried to make it sound like a joke, because I didn't want to admit how much I wanted to feel the story of it.

Carlos looked at me for a second longer than politeness required. "Just stay away from the windows if the wind is strong," he said.

"Noted," I said, and raised my water bottle like a toast.

He went back to the ropes. I told myself he was just being a good host. I did not tell myself he was watching the building with the wariness of someone who knew it could turn.

The rain started at dusk, sudden and heavy, like the sky had flipped a switch. The courtyard went from warm to drenched in a breath. The bougainvillea shook with the impact. The smell of wet stone rose in a wave. I stood in the doorway of the heritage wing, watching the water hammer the tiles and run in streams toward the drains.

The building groaned, a low wooden sound. It wasn't loud, but it was deep. It vibrated in the floor, in the soles of my sandals. I held the door frame and felt the tremor in the wood.

I went back to my room and pulled the shutters as far as they would go. They clacked in protest and stopped, leaving a sliver of light. The wind pushed at them from the outside. The gap made a sound like a whistle. I stuffed a towel against it and told myself that was clever.

The room was darker now, the rain drawing a curtain across the light. I turned on the bare bulb. It flickered twice, then steadied. The mosquito nets hung in the corners, still. The smell of damp wood was stronger. It made me think of my grandparents' shed, the one full of old tools and forgotten jars. That shed had always felt safe, because it was full of things that had lasted. This room felt safe for the same reason. I wanted it to, anyway.

I opened my journal and wrote about the rain. I wrote about the way the storm made the building feel alive. I wrote, The walls hold centuries and now they hold water. I underlined water.

When I looked up, the crack along the ceiling was wet. A thin line of damp had spread from it, darkening the plaster. I watched it for a while, trying to convince myself it was just condensation, just humidity. Old buildings breathe, I thought. They sweat. It's normal.

The thought was soothing, in a way. It gave the building a body I could understand, and therefore a behavior I could forgive.

My phone buzzed. A weather alert, in Spanish and then in English, scrolled across the screen: TROPICAL STORM ADVISORY. POSSIBLE FLOODING. STAY INDOORS.

I took a screenshot, because I wanted to post it later with a caption about riding out a storm in a 17th-century building. I didn't post it yet, because the Wi-Fi was weak and because I liked the idea of waiting until the moment felt ripe. I am always too conscious of my narrative.

I tried to picture the story from the outside, the way I knew people would see it: a girl in a mosquito net, sipping warm water, listening to history creak in the dark. I could almost hear the tone of the inevitable comment from my father about risk and common sense, and I could almost hear myself rolling my eyes and then, hours later, taking his advice. I imagined the story ending with a laugh, with me writing a caption about how the storm and the old beams made me feel small. I did not imagine the story ending any other way.

The wind picked up. The shutters rattled. The building groaned again, a little louder this time. The sound traveled along the beams like a voice. I sat on the bed and felt the metal frame shiver beneath me.

I should have gone downstairs. I should have asked if anyone else was staying in the heritage wing. I should have accepted that Seguro might be safer than Historia. But it felt like a betrayal, to myself and to the story I was already living in my head. I was not going to leave the room I had chosen because of a little rain and some dramatic weather alerts. That felt too much like admitting I was ordinary.

The light flickered again. A drip landed on the floor near the window, then another. The puddle grew slowly, polite, as if it were asking permission to exist. I put a towel under it and felt competent.

Outside, the rain moved sideways now. The wind drove it against the shutters with a persistent hiss. The building creaked in response, a slow, strained sound, like a ship.

I lay down and pulled the mosquito net closed, not for mosquitoes but because it felt like a boundary. The fabric made the light softer. I could hear the rain through it like applause. I tried to read, but the words on the page blurred with the sound of the storm.

I closed the book and listened. I listened to the wind. I listened to the building. I listened to the steady, dull heartbeat of water.

There are moments in travel where you can feel the story trying to become itself. This was one of those moments. I could feel the sentence forming: She stayed in a 400-year-old building during a tropical storm and listened to it breathe.

It was a good sentence. It felt like the kind of thing people would double-tap.

I smiled, because I wanted to believe I had chosen well.

The room answered with a soft, wooden sigh from the ceiling.

I told myself it was only the rain.

Outside, the storm kept coming.
