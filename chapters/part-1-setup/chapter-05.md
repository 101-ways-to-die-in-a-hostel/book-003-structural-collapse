# Chapter 05: The Courtesy of Gravity

The dark made the room smaller, the way a closet is smaller than it should be because you can hear the coat hangers breathe.

I lay still under the mosquito net, counting the seconds between the rain and the sounds the building made back to it. The rain was easy. The building was harder. The rain was a constant hiss. The building was a language of clicks, sighs, and an occasional sharp crack that made my ribcage try to climb out of me.

When you decide to be brave about something, you have to commit to the performance. The moment I got out of bed would be the moment I admitted I was afraid, which felt like the moment the whole story would shift into a different genre. So I stayed in the bed, in the dark, and waited for the next sound.

It came as a low creak above my head, like a person settling into a chair too old for them. Dust fell in a soft peppering onto my cheek. I wiped it away and tasted grit.

I told myself that the building was just adjusting to the wet. I told myself that wood swells and shrinks. I told myself I had read about this. I told myself I was a person who understood what she was hearing. None of those were exactly true. They were close enough.

The light in the hallway clicked on. It was a thin stripe under my door, a pale yellow line that made the darkness feel less absolute. It also meant someone was awake. The idea of another person in the building steadied me more than it should have.

I got out of bed.

The floor was cool and slightly damp under my sandals. The slant toward the outer wall felt more pronounced, or maybe I was just looking for it. I moved to the door and pressed my ear against it. I could hear voices downstairs, muffled and low. I could hear the rain. I could hear the building, the steady groan of old beams taking on new water.

I turned the handle and opened the door.

---

The hallway was darker than I expected. The light was coming from the stairwell, a weak bulb glowing over the landing. The air smelled like wet plaster and the metallic tang of rain. Somewhere, a bucket clinked against tile.

I walked toward the stairs with my phone in my hand, the screen an extra bit of light. The walls were damp enough to shine. The plaster had tiny bubbles, like it was trying to lift off the wall to breathe. A thin line of water ran along the baseboard and vanished under the stairs.

Halfway down, I passed a window. The shutters were shaking in their frame, the wind pushing them in small, violent breaths. I put my hand on the wall and felt the vibration. It was a deep pulse, as if the building had a heart and it was doing its best.

In the common room, most of the guests had gathered in clumps, sitting on sofas and plastic chairs, the air thick with wet clothes and muted chatter. A few candles were lit on the bar. The power hadn't gone out completely, but it was flickering, the overhead lights dim and unreliable. The bartender had turned the radio off. The storm was loud enough on its own.

Carlos was at the far end, crouched next to a bucket, mopping water that kept arriving faster than he could send it away. He looked up when he saw me, relief and worry crossing his face in quick succession.

"You are awake," he said.

"It got loud," I said.

"It is loud," he agreed. He pushed the mop across the tiles. The bucket water was brown at the edges. "We have some leaks in the courtyard. Nothing serious. Just rain. The city is old. She cries.
"
"That's one way to put it," I said.

He smiled, tired. "Do you need anything?" he asked.

I wanted to say, yes, a structural engineer. Instead I said, "Is everyone okay?"

He nodded. "Everyone okay. The modern wing is quiet. The old wing is... more dramatic. But you are used to that, yes?" He tried to make it a joke.

"I came for the drama," I said, and then hated myself for how true it was.

A group of Australians were sitting at the long table with a deck of cards they couldn't shuffle because their hands were wet. One of them looked up and said, "Feels like the whole building is breathing, hey?" Everyone laughed because it sounded poetic and also because no one wanted to say it out loud with sincerity.

"Breathing is good," the British guy with the beard said. "Breathing means it's alive." He raised his cup in a toast to the ceiling.

"Everything is alive until it isn't," June said, and I froze because I hadn't expected to hear her name in this building. She was sitting on the end of the couch, her legs tucked up under her, a dry expression on her face as if the storm had inconvenienced her more than anything else.

"June?" I said.

She looked over and grinned. "Surprise. My hostel in Getsemani had a power outage and no beer, so I walked over." She held up a plastic cup of rum. "Your haunted house serves alcohol. I approve."

"You're in here?" I asked.

"Only for the storm," she said. "I don't trust this place in daylight, let alone in weather."

"You're very reassuring," I said, and she laughed.

We talked about nothing in particular, the way people talk in a room full of strangers when the rain is loud and the stakes are unknowable. She told me about a couple arguing in Spanish in her hostel, about a man who tried to sell her a bracelet for the equivalent of her grocery budget. I told her about the gecko that lived in my room and how I had named it after a professor I didn't like. It was a lie, but a good one.

The power flickered again. The overhead light winked out for a full second. The candles grew brighter, the shadows jumping in place. For a moment the room felt like a stage in a play. Then the light returned, and everyone exhaled like they had been holding their breath on purpose.

Carlos came over with a small stack of candles. "If the power goes, we will leave these in the hall," he said. "No one should be in the dark." He looked at me when he said it.

"Thanks," I said.

He hesitated, then added, "If you want to sleep in the common room tonight, you can. It is ugly, but it is dry." The way he said ugly made me feel like he was apologizing for the building. Or for himself.

I pictured myself on a couch with someone else's damp blanket, listening to the storm and the sounds of other people sleeping. I pictured the morning after, the awkwardness of being the girl who couldn't handle the heritage wing. The thought tightened my chest in a way that had nothing to do with the air.

"I'm fine," I said. "I'll be okay."

Carlos nodded like he had heard that sentence a thousand times and never liked it. He moved away to mop another puddle.

June leaned over and said, "You don't owe anyone bravery, you know." Her voice was quiet, so only I could hear it.

"I know," I said, even though I wasn't sure I did.

The storm hit the building again. There was a deep, long groan that traveled across the ceiling beams and into the floor. The Australians paused their card game. The British guy raised his cup like a salute. Someone laughed too loud.

"It's fine," someone said.

I smiled because everyone else was smiling. I held the smile in place like a door wedge.

By midnight, the rain had become a steady curtain. The wind still came in pulses, but the sharpest edges of it had dulled. The room felt less like a shelter and more like a waiting room. People drifted toward their dorms, carrying their cups and their unspoken worry. June squeezed my shoulder as she left.

"If you change your mind, text me," she said. "I'll drag you to safety with my superior Canadian strength." She said it like a joke. It didn't sound like one.

I nodded. I watched her go, then watched the water creep across the tiles like it had a plan.

When the common room emptied, I had a brief, absurd moment of wanting to stay. It felt like leaving a lifeboat. But the room was mine, the story was mine, and I had already posted about it. I wanted the building to be more dramatic than I was.

I went back upstairs.

The hallway to Historia was even darker now, the only light a candle someone had left on the floor by the waiver sign. The flame made the words look like they were floating. I could read the English now if I wanted to. I didn't stop. The hallway narrowed. The air thickened. The damp smelled like a riverbed.

In my room, the darkness was complete except for my phone's glow. I turned the flashlight on and swept it across the walls. The beam above my bed looked the same, which should have been reassuring. The crack beside it looked darker, damp with rainwater. A line of water had run down the wall and dried into a map.

I pulled the mosquito net back and sat on the edge of the mattress. The bed sank a fraction and the frame made a soft metallic groan. I could feel the floor slant under my weight, a polite tilt toward the outer wall. I told myself the slant had been there when I arrived. I told myself it hadn't gotten worse. I told myself that I wasn't qualified to measure it anyway.

I opened my journal, because writing makes me feel like I am making sense of things. I wrote:

The house is not a house. It is a compromise.

I underlined compromise, then immediately crossed it out and wrote instead: The house is a body. The body is tired.

I stared at the line and felt ridiculous. I also felt right.

The rain softened. It didn't stop, but it eased. The wind paused, like it had to inhale. In the brief quiet, I could hear the building in a different way. It wasn't the roar of water or the rattle of shutters. It was a slower sound, a long, low settling that moved along the ceiling. It sounded like a sigh from somewhere too large to be a person.

I waited for the next sound. My heart beat too loud. The room smelled like wet wood and my own damp skin.

The gecko appeared above the door, belly flat against the plaster. It looked at me, then at the ceiling, as if it understood something I didn't. It stayed for a long moment, then crawled into a crack near the beam. I felt a childish urge to follow it, to crawl into the ceiling with it and let the building decide what to do. Instead I lay back on the mattress and stared at the net.

My phone buzzed. A comment on my last post: "This is such a vibe." I stared at it and did not respond.

The light flickered in my room once, a dying electrical hiccup. It went out. The candlelight from the hallway slid under the door. I could hear someone laugh downstairs, a burst of sound and then nothing.

I could have left. I could have gone back to the common room or slept on the courtyard hammock or even knocked on June's door. I did not. I stayed because I had chosen this room, and I was not ready to admit that my choice might have been a mistake. I stayed because I had signed the waiver and told myself that reading it later would be fine. I stayed because I wanted the story and I didn't know how to ask for the ending to be different.

I pulled the net closed around me. It felt like a gesture of protection even as I knew it could do nothing. It brushed my cheek, smelled of bleach and damp. I closed my eyes.

The building creaked again, a slow, deep sound. The bed moved under me a fraction. I opened my eyes. In the dim light, the beam above me looked like a rib. I imagined the weight it held. I imagined the history pressing down. I imagined the termites that had eaten their way through the wood, a patient hunger.

A thought slid into my mind, clean and uninvited: If this room collapses, no one will hear me.

I sat up. I listened. The building went quiet again, as if offended by my imagination. The rain whispered. A droplet fell from the ceiling and hit the floor with a soft click.

I told myself I was being dramatic. I told myself I was tired. I told myself that people sleep in old buildings every night all over the world, and most of them wake up.

Eventually I slept, not because I was calm but because my body insisted. The last thing I remember before sleep was the feeling of the floor under the bed, the slight, constant tilt, like a boat moored at a dock.

The morning after the storm had the hungover quiet of a party that ended badly. The rain had thinned to a drizzle, the light gray and flat. The air smelled like wet stone and something metallic, the way old coins smell when you rub them together.

I woke with my hair damp and my sheets cool. The mosquito net clung to my shoulder. I pushed it aside and stood, feeling the ache in my back that comes from sleeping in a bed that has no opinions about ergonomics. The floor was wet in places, the tiles slick with a thin film. A small pile of plaster dust sat at the base of the wall like someone had left a gift.

I walked to the window and pushed the shutters open. They resisted, then moved with a tired scrape. The courtyard below was a shallow pool, the broken fountain overflowing and the chairs stacked on the tables like they were trying to stay dry. The bougainvillea sagged, its flowers dripping. The Wi-Fi bulb was off, a dark glass eye.

In the hallway, the candle had burned down to a stub, its wax pooled on the tile. The waiver sign was damp, the paper slightly wrinkled from humidity. I ran my finger along the bottom edge, then pulled my hand back as if I had touched something hot.

I took the stairs down to the courtyard. The steps were slick, and I moved slowly, my hand on the rail. In the common room, Carlos and Marta were already at work, moving chairs, mopping water, counting losses. The radio was back on, low and tinny, a salsa beat trying to make the morning feel normal.

"Morning," Carlos said when he saw me. He looked tired in a way that went beyond the night. His eyes were rimmed red, his hair still damp. There was a smear of plaster dust on his forearm.

"Is everything okay?" I asked.

"Yes," he said, and then, after a pause, "No. But we are fine." He shrugged. "The roof over the kitchen leaks. The courtyard drains are blocked. The building is... old." He gestured toward the ceiling, a helpless motion.

Marta walked past with a bucket. She caught my eye and made the sign of the cross, quick and practiced. Then she pointed toward the heritage wing with her chin and said something under her breath. I couldn't catch the words, but I recognized the tone. It was not a blessing.

I stepped into the courtyard. The water there was ankle-deep in places, reflecting the broken fountain and the tired sky. Someone had placed a line of bricks as a makeshift path. I picked my way across, shoes squelching, and sat on the edge of the fountain, which was cool and slick.

Ana came out of the modern wing, her hair wrapped in a towel. She looked at the courtyard and shook her head.

"How was Historia?" she asked.

"Dramatic," I said.

She smiled, then looked past me toward the heritage wing hallway, her expression tightening. "I slept in Seguro," she said. "I still didn't sleep." She said it like a confession.

"It's just a storm," I said, because I wanted it to be.

She looked at me for a long moment. "It is not just the storm," she said. "These old walls, they hold water. They hold history. They hold weight." She pointed at my shirt, the one with my college hoodie logo. "You are small. The building is not."

I wanted to tell her about my father and his beam stories, about how I was not as small as I looked. I wanted to tell her that I could handle myself. Instead I shrugged and said, "I like the old walls. They're honest." It sounded like something I'd put in a caption.

She laughed, kind but tired. "Honest does not mean safe," she said.

I nodded as if I agreed. I didn't disagree, either. I just didn't want to move.

Carlos appeared with a stack of clean towels. He placed them on the table and said, "If you need anything, just ask." He hesitated, then added, "We might close Historia for a day if the walls stay wet." He said it like a minor inconvenience, like a room service delay.

"Close it?" I said, trying to make the word sound like a question about scheduling.

"Just for the day," he said quickly. "So it can dry. You can stay in the common room or in Seguro. Same price." His eyes flicked to my face and then away.

The offer was gentle, almost casual, but I felt the weight of it anyway. I felt the story tilt, the narrative edge of the world shifting toward a decision. I imagined the caption I'd already drafted and how it would look if I left. I imagined myself explaining to my mother that I had moved because it was damp, and hearing her sigh of relief. I imagined the room being closed without me, the bed empty and the story unfinished.

"It's fine," I said. "I'll just... go out today. Let it dry." I made the decision sound like a plan.

Carlos nodded. "Okay," he said. "Just be careful." He turned away, because the conversation was over.

I felt a flare of something that might have been pride or panic. I told myself it was pride. I told myself I was choosing to be independent, to be brave. I did not tell myself I was choosing to be stubborn.

I walked back toward the heritage hallway to put my bag away before I went out. The corridor felt narrower in daylight, the walls sweating. The waiver sign was still pinned at eye level, its edges curling from the humidity. I stopped, finally, and read it.

The English was clipped and polite. GUESTS ACKNOWLEDGE THE HISTORIC NATURE OF THE BUILDING. GUESTS ASSUME RISK OF SETTLING, SHIFTING, WATER INTRUSION. The words were bland, bureaucratic, and somehow more frightening than any warning whispered in the hallway. It was the kind of language that made danger sound normal. It made it sound like part of the decor.

I read the Spanish too, slowly, the way you read a poem when you want it to mean something else. I knew enough to understand the rhythm of liability. I knew enough to understand that the building had been asking guests to sign away a piece of their safety for a long time.

I stood there longer than I should have. Marta passed behind me with her mop and didn't say anything. She didn't need to. The mop water smelled like bleach and wet earth. It left a trail on the tiles that looked like a chalk line drawn by the storm.

In the courtyard, someone had propped the front door open to let the air move. A line of wet towels hung from the balcony railing, a row of small white flags. The courtyard tiles shone with water. A gecko skittered across the wall near the fountain and disappeared into a crack like it had an appointment elsewhere.

I checked my phone and saw a message from my mother: Did you sleep? I stared at it, then typed Yes, fine. Storm passed. Love you. I hit send and felt a tiny flare of guilt, because the words were mostly true and still a lie. It was the kind of lie you tell because you want to be left alone, and because you want to be believed.

The British guy with the beard was sitting on the edge of a sofa, tying his shoes. He caught my eye and said, "Survived the storm?" in a voice that suggested survival was a punchline.

"Barely," I said.

He laughed and patted the armrest. "These old places, they have character. They also have insurance waivers. I reckon those cancel each other out."

"That's not how insurance works," I said, and he shrugged like it didn't matter.

He left, whistling, and the common room felt quieter. I looked up at the ceiling there, the newer beams, the clean lines. They were less impressive. They were also less worrying. I felt a flicker of envy toward the people who had booked the modern wing without thinking, who had not chosen their bed based on its age or its story. I wondered, briefly, if safety was just another kind of privilege. Then I wondered if that was a thought that made me interesting, or just defensive.

The courtyard was beginning to empty as the rain slowed. Guests drifted out to the street with umbrellas and small plastic ponchos. The city would smell clean for an hour and then return to its usual mix of salt, frying oil, and horse manure.

I went back upstairs to collect my bag, stepping over a fresh trail of plaster dust. In Historia, the light was brighter, the room looking normal in the way a room can look normal after it has not been. The beam above my bed was still sagging, the crack still thin. The puddle by the window had grown. I took a towel from the hall and mopped it up, because doing something with my hands made me feel like I could control the narrative.

I sat on the bed and stared at the ceiling. The room smelled like wet wood and something faintly sweet, like old paper. I took another photo. In the frame, the crack looked wider than it felt. I didn't know which was true.

I packed my day bag and left the room, telling myself I would be back in a few hours and the room would be dry and everything would be fine.

In the hallway, the candle had gone out. The air was still. Somewhere in the building, a beam creaked, a low sound that could have been settling or could have been warning. I paused, listening, then kept walking.

Outside, the sky was the color of wet cement. The city was going back to work, the street vendors already shouting, the cars splashing through puddles. It felt like a reset, like the storm had been a performance and the city had decided to move on.

I stepped into the street with my bag on my shoulder and a damp map in my pocket. I told myself I was going out for coffee, for sunlight, for a story to make sense of the night. I told myself I would come back to the room and it would be dry and I would laugh at how dramatic I had been.

As I turned the corner, I looked back at Casa Colonial Los Muertos. The facade was streaked dark where the rain had run down it. The shutters on the heritage wing were half-closed, stubborn, their wood swollen with water. For a second the building looked like it was watching me leave.

I walked away anyway.

Behind me, the hostel exhaled, long and low, the sound of a house that had held itself together through the night and was not sure how many more nights it could do the same.
