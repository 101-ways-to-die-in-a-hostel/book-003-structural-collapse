# Chapter 06: The Quiet Between Storms

The waiver had dried just enough to lie to me.

Its paper was still soft at the edges from humidity, but the words looked crisp now, the legal font squared off like it had never trembled. I ran my finger under the line that said GUESTS ASSUME RISK OF SETTLING and told myself that settling was an ordinary word, the way you say you are settling in or settling down. The building had settled for four hundred years, I told myself. It had not collapsed on any of those guests. The law had given it a polite verb. That was almost comforting.

The thing about risk is that it only feels abstract when it isn't yours.

I folded the waiver back into its plastic sleeve and left it on the wall. I told myself I was respecting the property. I told myself I was not, in any sense, hanging a warning above my own head.

---

The morning sun turned the wet courtyard into a shallow mirror. The broken fountain held a bowl of rainwater and mango leaves; it looked like a shrine to weather. Carlos had stacked chairs on tables, the legs pointing up like upside-down umbrellas. Marta mopped in slow, angry strokes, her bucket making a sound like it was swallowing the floor.

Everyone was quieter than the night before. That was how the day after a storm always felt in hostels, as if the building had been loud enough for all of us and now it was our turn to be still. The Australians were sitting with their phones, whispering about ferry times. The British guy with the beard was telling a story about a typhoon in Thailand to a pair of Canadians who looked too tired to be impressed. Ana sat at the table with a small coffee and a damp braid, staring at the courtyard like she was trying to decide if it was beautiful or just wet.

I sat on the edge of the fountain and pulled my phone out. The screen was streaked with fingerprints and dried rain. I opened my messages to my mother and watched the little green dot next to her name pulse. She was online. Of course she was online. It was still early in Surrey; she would be drinking tea and reading the news and pretending that the internet could make her a parent across the ocean.

I should have typed something reassuring. Instead I hit call.

She answered on the second ring. “Emma?” Her voice was too bright. She had been waiting for my name to appear, which meant she had been thinking about me in a way that always made me feel guilty.

“Hi,” I said, and heard the hoarseness in my own voice. It was the storm, I told myself. The humidity. The fact that I hadn't slept well. The fact that I was nineteen and far away and suddenly not convinced those two things were the same as brave.

“Are you all right? I saw a weather alert. I looked it up, I know it’s just a tropical storm, but I also know—”

“It's fine,” I said, too quickly. “Just loud. It’s not… it wasn’t a hurricane.”

There was a pause where I could hear her breathing. In the courtyard, someone dropped a plate and the sound made me flinch. I put my fingers to my temple and realized I was shaking, just a little, like the building had left a vibration in me.

“I signed a waiver,” I said, and laughed, which was the wrong sound for the sentence. “Can you imagine? I signed a waiver to sleep. It's very, um, authentic.”

She did not laugh. “Emma.”

The way she said my name was the way she said it when she had already decided she was worried and was trying to keep it from turning into a lecture. I could hear the caution in her tone, the carefulness. I could also hear the silent paragraph she wasn't saying: you are not a person who needs to prove anything to anyone.

“I’m okay,” I said, and then, because my voice cracked in a way that embarrassed me, I added, “I just didn’t sleep. It's so damp. Everything is damp. Even the walls feel damp. It’s gross.”

“Then move,” she said. “Please. There are hotels. You can afford—”

“I don’t want a hotel,” I said. “I didn’t come here to sit in air conditioning and eat room service. That’s not the point.”

“The point of a bed is to sleep,” she said.

I laughed again, and then, to my surprise, I cried. It was a quick, hot cry, the kind that ambushes you in public because you are so busy holding yourself together that you forget to breathe. I turned my face toward the fountain so no one would see, like the water could absorb my tears as a local expense.

“I’m just tired,” I said, wiping my cheeks with the back of my hand. “I’m okay. I just… it was a long night.”

“I know,” she said softly. “Listen. You don’t have to make everything hard for yourself just because you can. You can still be interesting in a safe room.”

The word safe landed between us like a dropped plate. I looked toward the heritage hallway, where the waiver sign glowed faintly in the light. I pictured my room and its beams and the way the air smelled like old paper. I pictured the bed and the mosquito net and the story I had already told about it.

“I know,” I said, because I did. “I love you.”

“I love you too,” she said. “Please, just… be smart.”

“I am,” I said, which was a lie and also a hope.

We hung up. I sat there for a minute, listening to the courtyard return to itself. The sound of mop water, the buzz of a fan, the distant call of a street vendor selling mango. I wiped my eyes and opened my phone. My reflection in the dark screen looked like a girl who had slept in damp sheets and cried by a broken fountain. I took a deep breath and put my glasses back on. I told myself it was a reset, like turning a page.

I opened Instagram and posted a photo of the wet courtyard with the caption: The morning after the storm feels like history drying out.

It was not my best line. It was enough.

---

I went out into the city to give the room time to dry and because I needed to remember that there were streets outside my hallway.

The air smelled washed. The sun was bright but a little softer, the way it is after rain when the humidity does the light a favor. Puddles sat in the cobblestones and reflected the colonial balconies as if they were trying to prove they had always been there. I walked toward the walled city with my journal in my bag and my phone in my hand, because I could not, despite my aspirations, choose one or the other.

A man was repainting the base of a yellow facade, his brush making quick, practiced strokes over a damp wall. The color glowed against the gray sky. I watched him for a moment, fascinated by the quiet persistence of maintenance. A woman swept water from her doorway with a broom so worn the bristles looked like hair. A boy in a school uniform jumped over a puddle and shouted when his foot landed in it anyway. The whole city felt like it was shaking itself dry.

I passed a building with scaffolding wrapped around it like a metal bandage. A sign announced RESTAURACION PATRIMONIAL in block letters. There was a banner above it with a smiling couple and the phrase VIVE LA HISTORIA. Live the history. I took a photo and considered a caption about the difference between lived history and curated history. I wrote something in my notes, deleted it, wrote it again, and then closed the app without posting.

At a corner near Plaza de la Trinidad, I stopped at a cart and bought a bag of arepas from a woman who called me cariño. The arepas were hot enough to burn my fingers and tasted like corn and salt and resilience. I stood in the shade and ate them, watching a group of tourists move past with matching sun hats. Their guide held up a tiny umbrella and said something about pirates. They looked appropriately horrified and delighted. I felt the usual prick of superiority and then the usual shame about feeling it.

In the cathedral, the air was cool and smelled like wax and stone. The pews were polished from generations of hands. The ceiling was high and painted with saints I didn't know. I sat in the back, mostly to let the quiet settle over me. A woman lit a candle at the altar and knelt. The flame trembled but did not go out. I thought about my mother and what she would do if she were here. I thought about the different kinds of prayer. I didn't pray, exactly, but I did let myself want the ceiling to stay where it was.

When I walked out, the street had filled with people again, the day moving on. I felt more like myself, which is to say, I felt more like the version of myself I had paid to be. The storm felt like a story now, something I could fold and carry. That was a dangerous feeling, because it made me think I had already done the hard part.

On the way back, I passed a small hardware store with stacks of two-by-fours leaning against the wall. A man with a radio perched on his shoulder was telling someone about the weather. I caught fragments: another system, maybe next week, sea winds, the word tormenta. He shook his head and tsked. I moved on before the words could settle.

I cut through a side street and ended up in a small museum I hadn't meant to visit. It was the kind of museum that charged the price of a coffee and then let you wander among artifacts that deserved better. A guide in a white shirt stood by a model of the city walls and told a family in Spanish about the way the fortifications had been repaired over and over, the layers of lime mortar like tree rings. I lingered near the edge of the group, pretending I was just reading the labels.

The guide tapped the model with a pointer. "La ciudad es vieja," he said. "Y el mar la come." The city is old, and the sea eats it. He explained how the salt air worked its way into stone, how the rain softened the old adobe, how people kept painting and patching and hoping. The words sounded like a story about maintenance as a form of devotion. I wrote them down in my notebook as if they were a quote I could use later.

In the next room, there was a photograph of a collapsed balcony, a caption about an accident in the 1990s and a note about restoration. I stared at it longer than I meant to. The balcony in the photo had given up with a neat, final angle, as if it had folded itself on purpose. The caption was clinical. Nobody looked alarmed in the photo. That was the thing about old buildings: you were either admiring them or cleaning up after them, and the difference was only time.

I left the museum with a folded brochure in my bag and the taste of dust in my mouth. The street outside was bright and loud and alive in a way the museum had not been. A man shouted the price of coconuts. A horse clopped past, its hooves ringing on wet stone. A couple posed for a photo in front of a peeling blue door, and I wanted to tell them to stand a few inches to the left for better light. I did not.

I got back to Casa Colonial just before noon. The courtyard was mostly dry, the tiles streaked with white mineral lines where the water had evaporated. The air inside was still damp, but it felt like the building was trying to pretend it wasn't. Carlos was at the reception desk with a stack of paperwork, his brow furrowed. He looked up when I walked in.

“You went out,” he said, and it sounded like a question and a relief.

“Letting the room dry,” I said. “And myself.”

He nodded. “Good. It will help.” He hesitated, then added, “We have moved some guests to Seguro for today. The heritage wing is… wet.”

“I saw,” I said. “It’ll be fine.”

He started to say something, then stopped. He ran his fingers through his hair, making the damp strands stand up. “There is a small crack in the hallway now,” he said. “Nothing serious. We will patch.”

“Old buildings crack,” I said, because I could not stop myself from defending the building I had chosen. It felt, in a strange way, like defending my own judgment.

“Yes,” he said. “And sometimes they crack more.”

I smiled as if it were a joke. He didn't.

In Historia, the air was warmer and thick with that slow smell of wet wood. The mosquito nets hung limp and slightly stained from damp. My sheets had a faint mildew edge, like a library book that had been left near a window. I pulled the window shutters open and let the light in, hoping the sun could clean what I couldn't.

The bed had sunk a little deeper into the floor. Not dramatically. Just enough that I noticed because I was looking for it. The metal legs rested more firmly in the uneven tiles, like they were sinking into soft ground. I pressed down on the mattress and watched the frame respond, a small shudder, like a person waking from a bad dream.

I knelt on the floor and ran my fingers along the base of the wall. The plaster was cool and damp. A thin line of white powder gathered at the edge where the wall met the floor. I picked up a pinch of it and rubbed it between my fingers. It felt like chalk. It smelled faintly of old paper and something alive.

Termite dust, I thought, and then told myself I was being melodramatic. The word termite was too dramatic for a pinch of powder. It could have been plaster, or adobe, or something else equally unromantic. I wiped it on my pants and stood.

The crack beside the central beam looked thicker, or maybe I was looking too closely. I put my phone on the bed and took another photo, the same angle as the one I’d taken on Day One. The sag in the beam looked deeper in this photo, but photos lied as often as people did. The light was different. The angle was different. The building was the same, I told myself.

I opened my notes app and started to type a caption: The building is a palimpsest, the damp making the layers visible. I deleted palimpsest because it felt like cheating. I typed: The building is a body, and it is drying. I deleted that too. The words felt tired, like the building.

My phone buzzed with a notification: a comment on my storm post. “This is such a vibe.” I stared at it, then laughed out loud, the sound too sharp for the room. The gecko in the wall above my bed clicked and disappeared. It had better timing than me.

I opened my journal instead. I wrote:

I chose the oldest room because I wanted the most authentic story. I am now in a room that smells like wet paper. I am not sure if paper is supposed to smell like history or like mold.

I underlined mold and then wished I hadn't.

The afternoon dragged, heavy with heat. I tried to work on a short piece for my gap year application, but the Wi-Fi in Historia was a weak, intermittent thing, like the building itself. I moved my laptop to the courtyard and sat under the one bulb, where the signal was strongest. The air was sticky. The sound of the city drifted in through the open doorway: vendors calling, motorbikes whining, a dog barking at something that had left five minutes ago.

June sat across from me, barefoot, her hair damp from a shower. “You survived,” she said.

“Barely,” I said, and tried to make it a joke.

“Are you moving rooms?” she asked, casual but not.

“I’m letting it dry,” I said.

June nodded like she understood, which was worse than if she had argued. “I get it,” she said. “You picked the story room. Hard to walk away.”

I looked down at my laptop screen, the cursor blinking. “It’s not just the story,” I said. “It’s… I don't know. The room makes me feel like I'm part of something. I hate that I care about that, but I do.”

“Everyone cares about being part of something,” she said. “Some people join gyms. You sleep under a four-hundred-year-old beam.”

I laughed. It sounded wrong in the courtyard.

A local man walked through with a stack of chairs, glanced toward the heritage wing, and then kept walking without a pause. His eyes flicked up at the ceiling when he passed. That tiny gesture—a look and a move on—felt more like a warning than any sign.

“See?” June said, following my gaze. “They know.”

“Know what?” I asked, even though I didn't want the answer.

“That old buildings are like old people,” she said. “They can be charming and fragile at the same time. You don’t lean on them too hard.”

I wanted to tell her that I wasn't leaning. I wanted to tell her that all I did was sleep. I wanted to tell her that sleep shouldn't count as pressure. I wanted to tell her I had read the waiver now, I wasn't stupid. None of those words came out. Instead I said, “I’ll be careful.”

June raised an eyebrow. “Careful is a verb that requires something to do,” she said.

“What do you suggest?” I asked.

“Move rooms. Or accept that you’re not actually careful,” she said. She smiled so it didn't sting. “Anyway. I'm going to the market. You want anything?”

“Fruit,” I said. “Mango if it doesn't bankrupt you.”

She stood, stretched, and shook her head. “Mango can bankrupt anyone if it's ripe enough.” She walked out into the street, leaving the courtyard to its slow heat.

I stared at the blinking cursor and typed a single sentence: The storm has passed and the building is drying, which means the danger has passed and the building is safe.

I stared at it and then deleted it. I did not believe it. I wanted to.

That evening, the courtyard filled again, not with panic but with the soft, tired energy of people who had survived something and now wanted to pretend it hadn't mattered. Ana cooked rice in the kitchen and offered me a plate. We ate at the plastic table while the air slowly cooled. The rice tasted like garlic and lime and something smoky from the pan. It felt like real food in a place that mostly served bread.

“Are you okay?” she asked, halfway through the plate.

“Yes,” I said. It was easier to say it than to decide if it was true.

“You called your mother?” she asked, nodding toward my phone on the table.

“I did,” I said. “She told me to move rooms.”

Ana made a small noise of agreement. “Mothers are often correct.”

I smirked. “I told her I didn’t want a hotel.”

“Seguro is not a hotel,” Ana said. “It is a room with fewer ghosts.”

“You believe in ghosts?” I asked.

“No,” she said. “But I believe in walls.” She tapped the table, once, the way Carlos did when he was deciding how to say something. “They are older than us. They don’t care about our stories.”

“I’m not sure I believe that,” I said. “Walls are literally stories. They are, like, the most material record of history.”

Ana smiled. “You can write your essay. I will sleep somewhere that does not move.” She said it gently, but I felt it anyway.

We ate in silence for a moment. The courtyard smelled of warm stone and wet leaves. Somewhere nearby, a guitar started up, a slow, off-key version of a song I didn't know.

I wanted to tell Ana about my call with my mother, about how small I had felt in the courtyard, about the way the storm had made everything feel temporary. I wanted to tell her that I was tired of curating my bravery. Instead I asked her about Valencia and let her tell me about the beach there, about the way the light turned the water silver at night. It was easier to be a listener than a confession.

After dinner, I went upstairs. The hallway to Historia smelled drier now, the damp replaced by a faint chalky odor. The waiver sign had curled further at the edges, like it was trying to pull away from the wall. I touched the corner and it flaked a little. I told myself that was normal paper in humidity, not a sign of anything else.

In my room, the light was softer, the humidity less oppressive. The beam looked the same. The crack looked the same. The bed still tilted toward the outer wall. I rolled my suitcase a few inches away from the wall and sat on the bed to answer a few messages. My mother had sent another text: Love you. Be smart. She had added a heart emoji, which felt like a compromise between affection and authority.

I replied: Love you. I’m being careful.

I did not move the bed. I did not pack my bag. I did not go to Seguro. I lay down under the net and opened my book, the pages smelling faintly of dust. The words swam a little because I was tired, but I made myself read anyway. It felt like proof that I could still do normal things in a place that had tried to make me feel abnormal.

The building was quiet. The storm had passed. That quiet was its own kind of sound, a holding of breath. I listened for the creaks and found none. I listened for the rain and found only distant dripping from the courtyard drain. My muscles loosened. The weight in my chest eased. I told myself that this was evidence that I had been overreacting.

Then, somewhere above me, there was a sound like a low, soft pop. Not the sharp crack of a branch. A gentler sound, like a knuckle being pulled. The beam did not move. The ceiling did not shift. The sound happened and then the room returned to silence, as if it had never happened at all.

I lay still, my book open on my chest. I told myself it was just the wood drying, the building letting go of the storm. I told myself that old buildings make noises. I told myself I had paid for that noise. I told myself I was lucky to hear it.

The air smelled faintly of warm plaster and the citrus soap someone had used in the bathroom. A fan whirred somewhere in the modern wing, a sound thin and steady, like a reminder that other people were sleeping in rooms that did not tilt. I tried to inhale slowly, to make the room feel domestic instead of historic. The mosquito net brushed my shoulder when I shifted. It felt like a curtain in a play I had not rehearsed.

The darkness gathered slowly at the window. The courtyard light dimmed. The gecko clicked once in the wall and went quiet. I turned off my lamp and pulled the net around me like a curtain.

The quiet between storms felt almost kind. That was what made it dangerous.
