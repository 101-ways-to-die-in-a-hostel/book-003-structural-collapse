# Chapter 10: The First Hairline

The night did not end so much as it thinned. The rain eased, the wind stepped back, and the building stayed awake, making small sounds as if it had learned to whisper.

I lay under the mosquito net and listened to the roof breathe. The hiss of rain softened into a drip, then a pause, then another drip. The beam above me gave a slow, patient groan, the kind of sound a person makes when they wake up and realize they have to keep going. I told myself it was just the wood drying, releasing the storm it had held for hours. I told myself I was hearing nothing unusual. I told myself that if I were at home, in my own bed, I would call this the sound of a house settling and roll over and fall asleep.

Instead I lay very still and counted the seconds between each drip. It felt like a test, like if the drips stayed consistent then the building was fine. That is not how physics works, but it is how anxiety tries to make itself useful.

At some point the power went out for real. The bulb died with a small, apologetic click, and the room went black. The light from the hallway did not appear. The candle was out, or the door had swelled and blocked the gap. The darkness was thick enough to feel like a presence. I could hear my own breath, a sound too loud in a room full of older noises. I could taste dust on my tongue, grit between my teeth. I closed my eyes and told myself I was not afraid of the dark. I was afraid of the ceiling. It was a more specific fear, which made it feel more reasonable.

I dozed in fragments. Each time I drifted, a new sound would pull me back: a creak, a pop, a low, shivering groan. The building was not trying to be dramatic; it was simply existing in weather. It made me feel like a guest at someone else's long, unglamorous illness.

At three a.m., the wind came in a long, hot push that made the shutters clap twice. The bed frame vibrated. I gripped the edge of the mattress and waited for the vibration to stop. It did, but it left my heart awake. I reached for my phone and saw that it had 7% battery. It felt like a betrayal. I turned it off to save what was left, which is an absurd thing to do when you are lying under a beam you suspect might fail. You don't save battery for a morning that might not arrive.

I thought about the waiver. I thought about how I had signed it because I didn't want to be dramatic. I thought about how, in a different context, signing a waiver would make me feel brave. Now it felt like I had signed my name to a story that didn't belong to me yet.

I told myself that I had made a choice and that choices meant something. I told myself that sleeping in the oldest room wasn't just about a photo. It was about wanting to understand the city in a way that wasn't just a checklist of restaurants and rooftop bars. I told myself that understanding had to involve discomfort, that it had to involve risk, that it had to involve me doing the thing I said I would do. I told myself this because it sounded like a justification and because I needed one.

The building made another soft, wet pop. I froze and then pretended I hadn't. The pop did not come again. The silence that followed was too complete, as if the house itself had paused to see if I would leave. I did not.

When the first light came, it was gray and damp and flat, the kind of light that makes everything look slightly older. I lay there for a moment and listened to the city waking. A motorbike. A rooster. A vendor calling out fruit prices. The building was quiet now, which was almost worse. Quiet meant all the noises had already happened.

I sat up and the floor slanted under me, gentle but undeniable. I put my water bottle on the tile and watched it roll, a small, obedient surrender. I caught it with my foot and set it upright against the wall. It stayed because I told it to. That felt like control.

The beam above me looked darker, the wood swollen with moisture. The crack beside it was still there, a thin line with a slight curve. It looked a fraction longer than yesterday. It might have been the light. It might have been my brain, which had decided to measure everything now.

I took a photo anyway.

---

The courtyard smelled like coffee and damp stone and something faintly sweet, like fruit fermenting in the heat. The broken fountain had collected more leaves, and someone had fished out the cigarette butt, which made it look almost intentional. The chairs were back on the ground. The hostel was trying to look normal.

Carlos was already at the reception desk, a pile of paperwork in front of him and a radio beside him whispering Spanish. He looked up when I walked in and offered a smile that made his eyes look tired.

"Rough night?" he asked.

"It was loud," I said.

He nodded, as if the building itself were a child who had kept everyone up. "More rain tonight," he said, like he was warning me about a party.

"I saw the alert," I said.

He glanced down at the papers, then back at me. "If you want to move for a night or two, we can do that. The modern wing is dry." He said dry the way people say safe without saying it.

"I'm fine," I said, because I had practiced saying it and because I was already tired of the conversation.

Carlos's smile tightened. "Okay. But if the door sticks, lift and pull. It swells when it is humid."

"Right," I said. The door sticking was a practical detail. It was also a warning that the building was shifting in ways I could feel.

June was in the courtyard with her camera, snapping photos of the light hitting the wet tiles. Ana sat at the table peeling a mango in a continuous strip, the skin curling like ribbon. I joined them because I wanted to be in a place with other people, and because I wanted witnesses.

"You look like you slept with a very talkative ghost," June said.

"The ghost was a gecko," I said. "It kept falling out of the ceiling."

"That's a message," Ana said.

"That the geckos are bad at sleeping?" I asked.

"That the ceiling has openings," she said, and then smiled like she was joking. She was not entirely joking.

I ate a piece of mango and felt the sugar hit my tongue. The fruit tasted like a reward. It made me feel less ridiculous for being anxious about a crack in a ceiling when I was also surrounded by so much color and life.

"We should go to the market," June said. "Before the rain. I want more film, and you want a reason to avoid your room."

"I do not want to avoid my room," I said, and she laughed like I had made a joke.

---

The market was loud enough to drown out any internal monologue. It smelled like fish on ice, ripe mango, fried oil, and the sweet rot of something that had been left out too long. The aisles were narrow, the air thick. A woman in a red dress balanced a tray of coconut candies on her head and moved through the crowd like a ship through water.

June bought film and I bought guava because I wanted to prove I was still a person who did normal things. The seeds stuck in my teeth. I took photos of a man mending a chair with wire, of a boy stacking plantains in a pyramid, of a painted sign advertising repairs. The sign said REPARACIONES in block letters and someone had drawn a cartoon hammer next to it with a smiley face. I thought about how repair is always either a warning or a promise.

We passed a stall selling candles and paper marigolds, bright orange and thin as breath. The woman behind the stall smiled at me and said, "Para los muertos," and I nodded, pretending I understood. It was almost Day of the Dead, the city already slipping into its ritual of remembering. I bought a small marigold made of paper and tucked it into my bag because I liked the idea of carrying a symbol of memory with me. I did not think about how literal that might become.

June nudged me as we walked past a row of old houses with flaking paint. "That one's leaning," she said, pointing.

It was. The balcony above the door bowed slightly toward the street, its wooden supports a little too curved to feel comfortable. A man sat in the doorway with a phone in his hand, scrolling as if his building were not doing a slow shrug.

"It's fine," I said, and then realized I sounded like I was talking about my room.

June didn't comment. She just took a photo. There is a kind of patience in photographers that I sometimes mistake for detachment.

We walked back through the heat. The sky had flattened into a pale, hazy gray, the edges of the clouds thickening. The air smelled like rain in advance, that metallic scent that makes your skin brace itself. I tightened my grip on my bag and felt the paper marigold crinkle.

"You're going to move, right?" June asked, as casually as she could.

"Maybe," I said, because it was the only answer that didn't feel like a lie.

"You don't owe anyone consistency," she said.

"I know," I said. I did. The problem was that I owed myself a story. It was a smaller debt and a louder one.

---

We ducked into a cafe near the plaza because the heat had started to feel like an argument. The place was small and bright, the kind of cafe that makes you feel like you are inside a postcard. A fan hung from the ceiling and did its best, pushing warm air in slow circles. The walls were painted white, and a single framed photo showed the same street in the 1950s, the same balconies, the same heat, the same tilt in the stones. It looked like proof that time was a loop rather than a line.

June ordered an iced coffee with condensed milk. I ordered a black coffee because I wanted to be the kind of person who could handle it. It arrived in a small glass that burned my fingertips. The coffee tasted like ash and citrus and a strange, sweet bitterness. I told myself it was good because it was authentic, which is how I justified almost everything.

We sat at a table by the open window. Outside, a man was patching a wall with plaster, his fingers moving fast, his shoulders set. He was smoothing the surface in quick strokes, making a crack disappear by covering it with something new. I watched him and thought about the crack in my ceiling, about how it would also be covered one day, smoothed and painted, filed into the category of solved.

"Do you ever feel like we're just collecting warnings?" I asked, surprising myself.

June lifted her eyebrows. "Warnings from where? From you? From the building? From the weather app?" She stirred her coffee. "Yes. That's travel. You pick which warnings to listen to and which ones to turn into a story."

"That's the problem," I said. "I keep turning them into stories."

"That is literally your job," she said.

"I don't think it is," I said. "I think it's just... my reflex." I took a sip and burned my tongue, which felt like a punishment for honesty.

June watched me over her glass. "You don't have to make a point out of everything," she said. "Sometimes you just move rooms because the ceiling is making weird noises."

"That's the thing," I said. "The ceiling has always made weird noises. It's an old building. The noise is the point."

"The noise is a feature until it isn't," she said, and then added, "Also, if you use 'feature' and 'noise' in the same sentence again, you owe me a coffee."

I laughed, which felt good in a way I hadn't noticed I needed. Outside, the man finished patching the wall and stepped back. He wiped his hands on his jeans, then looked up at the building like he was checking if it was convinced. He didn't smile.

The cafe had a small stack of newspapers near the door. I pulled one toward me and scanned the front page. The headline was about a soccer match. Below it, in smaller print, there was a short piece about storm preparations in the historic district. It mentioned that inspections were being done, that residents were encouraged to report cracks or leaks. It mentioned that older buildings were vulnerable to heavy rain. It did not mention the hostel by name, because no one puts their panic in a headline unless they have to.

I slid the paper back and pretended the coffee was the only thing in front of me. The fan hummed. The street outside glowed pale. A woman carrying a basket of flowers walked by, the blooms bright against the gray. The city looked like it was trying to be cheerful anyway, as if cheerfulness were a form of reinforcement.

My phone buzzed. A message from my mother: "Any updates on the storm? BBC says it might be stronger tonight. Love you."

I stared at the message and considered telling her the truth: that the building was shifting, that the door was sticking, that the crack in my ceiling had grown teeth. I pictured her face and felt my resolve soften. I typed, "All good. Just rain. Having coffee. Love you." It felt like a lie, but it also felt like mercy.

June watched me type. "Mum?" she asked.

"Of course," I said. "She worries."

"It's allowed," she said. "You're allowed, too."

I took another sip of coffee, and it tasted like regret and sugar. I looked out the window again. The patched wall was already drying, the plaster lightening as the water left it. It would look whole by tonight. The crack would still be there under the surface, waiting for rain. That was the thing about repairs: they could be both necessary and cosmetic, both care and cover. I wondered which category our hostel belonged to.

June drained her glass and stood. "We should go before the sky changes its mind," she said.

I nodded and paid the bill, which felt too cheap for how much I had just borrowed from the word "authentic." As we stepped back into the heat, the air smelled sharper, the edges of the clouds darker. The city was swallowing humidity again, preparing itself for another round.

As we walked, we passed a church with a bell tower wrapped in scaffolding. A sign on the fence said RESTORATION IN PROGRESS. A smaller sign beneath it said NO ENTRY DURING STORM. A man in a hard hat stood by the gate, arms crossed, watching the sky. He looked bored and vigilant at the same time. I wanted to ask him how often the storm made him stay late. I didn't.

We cut through a narrow street where the stones were uneven and slick from morning rain. A woman in a doorway watched us pass, her face unreadable. She glanced up at the eaves and then back to me. She said something in Spanish I didn't catch and made a small, dismissive motion with her hand. It might have meant "go home" or "don't stand there" or "it will pass." I took it as a warning because I was already collecting them.

---

Back at the hostel, the air was cooler inside, the stone walls holding the last of the storm's dampness. Carlos had put a new bucket at the end of the heritage hallway, under a ceiling seam that hadn't been leaking before. The bucket was clean and empty, a quiet prophecy.

I stopped at the waiver sign and read it again, as if the words might have changed. STRUCTURAL MOVEMENT. WATER INTRUSION. GUESTS ASSUME ALL RISK. The ink had blurred slightly at the edges from humidity, as if the building itself were sweating the letters.

In my room, the floor felt even more slanted than in the morning. I put my water bottle down and watched it roll without hesitation. I picked it up and set it on the bed. The bed sank a fraction, a soft groan from the frame. I told myself that metal creaks, too. I told myself that the noise didn't mean the floor was giving way. I told myself that if it did, I would hear it.

I opened the shutters to let in air. The wood stuck halfway, then gave with a reluctant scrape. A curl of paint fell to the floor like a sliver of skin. I left it there. I sat at the edge of the bed and opened my journal.

I wrote: The building is old, and I am romantic about it. This is either a brave choice or a stupid one. I can't tell the difference.

I underlined stupid. It felt honest. It also felt like a joke I wasn't sure I wanted to tell.

Outside, the first drops of rain began to fall, soft and slow. The sound was almost gentle, a light tapping on the shutters. It made the room feel quieter by comparison. I could hear the small sounds of the building responding: a click in the wall, a groan above the beam, the soft shift of wood under water.

I went downstairs when the rain picked up, carrying my book and a cardigan I did not need. The common room had filled with people who didn't want to be in their rooms. Someone had put on salsa music to compete with the storm. The bartender poured rum into plastic cups without being asked. The air smelled like wet clothes and lime.

Carlos moved through the room with a flashlight and a stack of candles, handing them out like he was distributing calm. When he reached me, he paused.

"If the storm gets worse, we may ask everyone in the heritage wing to move," he said.

"Tonight?" I asked.

"Maybe," he said. He sounded like he didn't want to commit to the word.

"Okay," I said, and felt my stomach tighten. The word maybe meant uncertainty, and uncertainty is where fear lives.

June found me by the bar. "You heard him?" she asked.

"Yes," I said. "If it gets worse." I tried to make it sound casual.

"Are you going to wait for worse?" she asked.

I didn't answer right away. The rain was loud enough to be a voice of its own. The building groaned in response, a long, tired sound that moved through the floor and into my bones. People paused, the conversation skipping, then resumed. It was a sound the building had made before, but it felt different now, heavier, like the structure was reminding us of its weight.

"I don't want to be the girl who panics," I said.

"You're already the girl who listens," June said. "That's better."

I wanted to say something clever back. Instead I nodded. She patted my arm and went to sit with Ana.

The storm pushed harder. The courtyard flooded at the edges. The broken fountain overflowed. I watched the water rise along the tiles, a slow, steady creep. It was not dramatic. It was patient. That felt worse.

Carlos came back through the room, face damp, hair plastered to his forehead. He looked at me and hesitated.

"Emma," he said, and then lowered his voice. "I know you like the room. But if it were my sister, I would tell her to move."

The words landed like a hand on my shoulder. They were not a threat. They were a kindness. That was what made them hard.

I opened my mouth to answer and found that I could not say I am fine without it feeling like a lie. I could also not say I will move without it feeling like a failure. The two versions of myself stood in front of me like doors. I wanted to pick a third door that did not exist.

"Let me think," I said.

He nodded once, a small motion that looked like relief and resignation at the same time.

---

I went upstairs before I decided, because I wanted to see the room in the rain. That is something I am not proud of. There is a part of me that wanted to see if my fear would be photogenic.

The hallway was darker than usual, the light from the common room barely reaching. The bucket by the seam was half full now, the drip steady. I stepped around it and felt the floor slope. It was subtle, but it was there, the whole hallway leaning toward the outer wall like a tired person.

My door stuck. I lifted and pulled, as Carlos had instructed. It opened with a long scrape, the sound of wood giving in on itself. The room smelled damp and earthy, like a book that had been left in the rain. The beam above my bed looked darker, the crack beside it a little longer, or maybe it was my eyes adjusting. The light was low and yellow. Shadows made the ceiling look more uneven than it should.

I put my hand on the wall and felt it vibrate with the wind. The vibration was steady, a small pulse, like the building had a heartbeat. It should have been comforting. It was not.

I set my phone on the bed and turned on the flashlight. The beam of light caught the ceiling. There, beside the main crack, was a new line of plaster, thin as a thread, running in a quiet curve toward the window.

It had not been there this morning.

I stared at it for a long moment, trying to decide if it was really new or just newly visible. The line was clean, pale against the darker plaster. I reached up and touched it. A small flake came away on my fingertip, dust soft as flour.

The rain hammered the shutters. The wall under my palm vibrated. The bed frame creaked when I shifted my weight. Everything in the room felt like it was answering something outside of itself.

I took a photo of the crack. My hand shook just enough that the image blurred. I deleted it and took another. It was clearer. The crack looked larger in the photo than it did in life, but that was not reassuring. It meant I had proof.

I imagined going downstairs, telling Carlos, letting him move me to Seguro, sleeping in a bed that did not tilt, a room that did not smell like wet paper. I imagined the relief in my mother's voice when I told her. I imagined June raising her eyebrows and saying, Finally. I imagined myself in the morning, embarrassed, already rewriting the story to make the move sound intentional. Self-care. Safety. A lesson learned.

I also imagined staying, convincing myself the crack was just plaster, that plaster is not structure, that the building had survived worse. I imagined waking up in the same bed, and writing a caption about how the storm tested the house and the house held. I imagined the comments.

I stood in the room with those two stories and felt the weight of them. The rain made it feel heavier.

My phone buzzed with a message from my mother. The screen lit up with her name, and for a second I couldn't move. I let it buzz until the screen went dark. The silence that followed was too loud.

I sat on the bed and stared at the crack, at the new line, at the old beam. The building creaked once, a long, low sound, like a throat clearing before speech.

I stood up.

I turned off the flashlight.

I closed the shutters as far as they would go.

I pulled the mosquito net around the bed.

I lay down.

I told myself I would decide in the morning.

Outside, the storm gathered itself again.

Inside, the new crack waited, thin and bright as a promise.
