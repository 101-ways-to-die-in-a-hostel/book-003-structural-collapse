# Chapter 09: The Architecture of Doubt

The pop that woke me up was small, almost polite, but the silence after it was absolute, the kind of silence that makes you check if you're still breathing.

I lay there under the mosquito net, eyes open, listening to the rain thicken from tapping to drumming. The shutters rattled in their swollen frames. The fan was off. The air was heavy and warm, the kind of heat that makes damp sheets cling to your skin. Somewhere in the room, water found its way down a wall, a tiny trickle that I could hear if I held my breath. I did, for a beat, just to see. The sound was real. It wasn't in my head. That was worse.

I told myself the pop was a nail expanding or a gecko landing or the building doing what old buildings do: talk to themselves. I told myself that if it were anything serious I would have heard a crack, a proper one, a movie sound, a branch snapping, a gunshot. I told myself that the fact I had to talk myself into being calm was not, in itself, evidence of danger.

The rain sharpened. The wood above me gave a low groan, a sound like a person stretching after a long flight. I tried to make a joke of it in my head, something about how even the beams were jet-lagged, but it didn't land. The groan resolved into a series of tiny creaks, quick and fluttery, like a mouse skittering across a ceiling. I pictured the beam, the one I'd photographed for Instagram, and felt a small, unhelpful surge of affection for it. It had survived empires, earthquakes, and the invention of Ryanair. It could survive a night of rain.

When I finally turned on my phone, the time glowed 1:12 a.m. There was a weather alert in Spanish with more exclamation points than I like in official notices. I opened it and scrolled, eyes catching on phrases like *vientos fuertes* and *riesgo de inundación*. The little storm icon had moved a notch closer to the coast. It wasn't a hurricane yet. It was a storm with aspirations.

I pressed the phone to my chest, the screen dimming. I could feel my heartbeat in my palm. I tried to imagine myself telling this story later, telling it well: the night I slept through a storm in a colonial building, listening to history breathe. It should have felt romantic. It felt like sitting next to a loud stranger on a bus, pretending to nap so I wouldn't have to make eye contact.

The hallway light flickered, thin stripes of brightness sliding under my door. For a second the room glowed, then went dark again. I waited, expecting another flicker. It did not come. I sat up, the mosquito net clinging to my hair like spider silk, and swung my legs over the side of the bunk. The floor was cooler than I expected, the tiles slick with humidity. I felt the slope immediately, the way my weight wanted to drift toward the outer wall.

You can't lie to your body about gravity. It always tells the truth first.

I pulled on my sandals and slipped out into the hall. The air was cooler there, the smell of wet plaster sharper. A bucket sat under a drip, catching it with a hollow plink that felt like a clock. The walls were sweating. The strip of wood Carlos had nailed earlier was darker, the moisture seeping into it. The door to the shared bathroom stood open, and the light inside threw a watery reflection on the tiles. I watched the reflection shake as the wind moved the shutters.

The sound of the building was different in the hallway. In my room it was all above me, the beam, the ceiling, the weight. Out here the noise came from the walls, a soft, constant rasp, as if the plaster were rubbing itself raw. I knew, intellectually, that buildings swell and shrink, that wood expands with moisture. I had read it. I could explain it in a caption, in a lecture, in a polite dinner conversation. It sounded less harmless when I was alone in a corridor at one in the morning with a bucket catching the roof.

I walked to the end of the hall where the staircase dropped into the courtyard. The stairs looked steeper at night, the light from below catching the worn centers of the steps. A gust of wind came through a gap in the shutters and lifted the edge of my T-shirt. I held the railing and felt it vibrate. Not much. Just enough to remind me it was connected to something else.

In the courtyard, a few of the other guests had left their laundry out. A pair of shorts clung to the line like a white flag. The broken fountain had turned into a basin, its bowl holding rainwater and a floating leaf. The bougainvillea was a dark shape against darker sky, its flowers invisible. A palm frond slapped the wall in the wind, a steady, impatient sound. I stood under the overhang and watched the rain streak the tiles. The air smelled like wet earth and old stone, a smell that makes you feel small in a good way. It almost worked.

Someone laughed downstairs, a muffled sound from the modern wing. It drifted up and vanished. I imagined the Seguro dorm, the newer beds, the straight floors. I imagined moving there, sliding my backpack onto a different mattress, telling myself it didn't change the story. I imagined posting about it: *Sometimes self-care is choosing a less photogenic room.* I imagined the comments. I imagined my mother sleeping better because of it. I imagined my own little pang of disappointment at the loss of my narrative. It was astonishing that my need to sound interesting could feel like a more urgent weight than the actual beam above my head.

I went back upstairs, my sandals whispering on the tiles. In the hallway, the bucket was half full. I crouched and stuck a finger in the water. It was cool and smelled faintly of rust. I looked up at the ceiling and caught a bead of water forming at a crack. It hesitated, then fell. It hit my finger, and for a second it felt like the building had touched me back.

Back in my room, the air had thickened. The rain had found its way through the shutters; the wall below the window was darker, damp. I dried it with my sleeve because I didn't know what else to do. I thought about the waiver I had signed, the paragraph that said *GUESTS ASSUME ALL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH HERITAGE FEATURES*. I wondered if water counted as a heritage feature. I wondered if I was now part of the feature set.

I lay down again and pulled the mosquito net closed. The mesh made the world softer, a filter I hadn't chosen. I put my phone on the pillow beside me and watched the time crawl. The building creaked again, a long, tired sound. Then it was quiet enough that I could hear my own teeth clicking together.

I fell asleep at some point, because when I opened my eyes again the rain had eased and the light through the shutters was gray-blue, the kind of light that makes everything look newly damp. I could smell coffee. I could also smell mildew. The two scents fought in the air and, as usual, neither won.

By breakfast, the courtyard was steaming in the sun like a pan left on the stove. The rain had rinsed the tiles clean, but it hadn't drained from the fountain. It sat there, a still pool with a single leaf at its center, the most peaceful thing in the hostel. The air was thick again, the humidity making the morning light feel heavy. I sat at the plastic table with a mug of coffee that tasted like burnt toast and ambition.

June arrived with her camera slung over her shoulder and a damp halo of frizz around her head. “Did you sleep?” she asked.

“Define sleep,” I said.

“Ah,” she said, and set her camera down. “So the building told you stories.”

“Mostly in the form of drips,” I said.

She laughed, then looked toward the heritage wing. “Storms are supposed to make old buildings feel romantic,” she said. “I think they just make them loud.”

Ana joined us, carrying a plate of fruit. She looked more tired than usual, her eyes a little puffy. “The rain woke me too,” she said. “It sounded like someone throwing coins at the roof.”

“Maybe the building was collecting,” I said.

“Then it should buy itself a new beam,” June said.

Carlos crossed the courtyard with a stack of folded tarps. He paused when he saw us, then walked over, his steps quick, as if he had been rehearsing his path. “Buenos días,” he said.

“Morning,” I said.

He looked at me. “The rain was strong. The roof in the hall leaked. We are putting more buckets. It is fine.”

“Fine is not a word that belongs to this building,” June said.

He smiled in a way that told me he knew. “We are in Cartagena,” he said. “Nothing is fine. Everything is also fine.” He glanced at the sky, which was still pale, the clouds not entirely gone. “There may be more rain later. We have a storm watch.”

Ana frowned. “Should people move rooms?” she asked.

Carlos hesitated, then gave a small shrug. “If you want. We have space in Seguro.”

June looked at me. She didn't say anything, which somehow felt like the loudest thing she could have done.

“I’m okay,” I said. I said it casually, like choosing a breakfast. “It was just noisy.”

Carlos nodded, as if he had expected me to refuse. “If the door sticks,” he said, “pull, then lift. It swells in rain.”

“Right,” I said, and sipped my coffee. It tasted slightly less like ambition and more like regret.

When he left, June raised an eyebrow. “You know you can move and still be interesting,” she said.

“I’m not trying to be interesting,” I said.

“Okay,” she said. “You're trying to be stubborn.”

I wanted to say I wasn't stubborn. I wanted to say I was principled, that there was a difference between being difficult and being committed to seeing something through. But I could also feel, like a bruise under my words, the truth: I had already told too many people I was staying in the old wing. I had built a small narrative fortress around that decision, and it felt flimsy to walk away from it now.

“Maybe I just want to be consistent,” I said.

“Consistency is a trap,” June said. “It's a grid you draw and then pretend it's the city.”

Ana smiled at her. “That is a very Canadian way to say you should be flexible.”

June shrugged. “I’m just saying the building doesn’t care about your story.”

“Neither do most people,” I said, and meant it as a joke. It landed as truth.

After breakfast, I decided to get out. The hostel felt too close, too damp. I told myself I wanted to see the city after the rain. I told myself I wanted to write about the way the streets shone. Both were true enough.

Cartagena in the morning after a storm looked freshly painted. The white facades in the old town glowed. The yellow walls looked almost indecent in their brightness. Bougainvillea hung over balconies in full, dripping pink. The stones of the street shone slick and black, reflecting the sky. It was beautiful in that way cities are after the mess has passed and everyone pretends it was always going to be fine.

I walked along the wall, the thick fortification that had held back pirates and time, and tried to imagine the weight of it. The stones were cool under my hand, damp still from the rain. A plaque explained that the wall had been built in the 1600s, that it had been repaired multiple times, that the city had almost lost it to neglect in the seventies. The plaque said *restored*, *preserved*, *heritage*. It did not say *rotting from the inside*, which would have been more honest.

A tour group gathered near a cannon, their guide talking about the English attacks, the way the city had held. The guide was young and charismatic, wearing a hat to keep the sun off his face. “These walls were built to last,” he said. “But even stone needs care. The ocean eats everything if you let it.”

I stopped and listened. He gestured toward a section of wall under scaffold. “We are always repairing,” he said. “Always. The city is a living thing.”

A woman in the group asked about funding. He laughed. “There is always money for heritage,” he said, then glanced at his notes as if he knew that was only half true. “Some heritage. Not all.”

I thought about the hostel, about the heritage wing marketed to tourists. I thought about the way the word heritage had started to feel like a synonym for *cheap* and *unstable* depending on who was saying it. I thought about my own essays and captions, the way I had written about colonialism as an aesthetic problem rather than a structural one.

I took a photo of the scaffold, because it made the wall look like it had braces. I posted it with a caption about the city wearing its repairs like jewelry. It was a good line. It was also a distraction.

By the time I reached Plaza de la Trinidad, the sun was full and hot. Vendors were selling mango slices with salt, and I bought a cup and sat on the church steps. The mango was bright and tangy, the salt stinging my lips. I watched a little boy chase pigeons and thought about the way people use old buildings as playgrounds. The church behind me was in its own battle with time; a crack ran up one corner of the facade, filled with fresh plaster that was a shade too bright. Someone had tried to make it disappear. It hadn't worked.

My phone buzzed. It was my mother, of course. *Saw a news alert about storms in Colombia. Are you okay?* I stared at the message. I considered telling her about the bucket, the drip, the pop. I considered telling her about the wall, the scaffolding, the guide who said everything needs care. I pictured her reaction: the sigh, the plea, the offer to book me a hotel. I didn't want to give her a story that would make her afraid. I didn't want to admit that her fear might have been reasonable.

*All good. Cleared up,* I typed. *Weather is dramatic but I'm fine.*

She sent back a heart and a thumbs-up. I felt a small, mean relief at the simplicity of it.

I walked back through the city as the afternoon heat settled in, heavier now that the rain had passed. My shirt stuck to my back. My hair felt too damp. I stopped at a bookshop and bought a slim paperback of essays about colonial architecture, because I am predictable when I feel guilty. I told myself I would read it. I told myself I was doing research.

On the way back to the hostel, I passed a house with a hand-painted sign that read SE VENDE. The balcony above it sagged slightly, its wooden supports bowed. A man stood in the doorway and watched the street like he was waiting for someone. I wondered if he was waiting for a buyer or for the building to give him a sign. I moved on, because there are only so many times you can let a stranger's property become your metaphor.

---

By late afternoon the sky had rearranged itself into something darker. The clouds were thicker, lower, the light flattened. The air smelled like wet dust, that pre-storm scent that makes your skin brace itself. I walked into the hostel and immediately felt the temperature drop, the cool damp of stone walls. The courtyard was quiet. People were inside, the way they are when the weather is thinking too hard.

Carlos was in the hallway again, this time with a stack of buckets. He glanced at me and gave a tired smile. “More rain,” he said.

“Yeah,” I said. “The sky is plotting.”

He laughed, a small sound. “If you hear anything strange, you let me know.”

“Define strange,” I said.

He gave me a look. “You know.”

In the heritage wing, the air felt thick, the walls damp. I opened my door and found my bed exactly as I'd left it: notebook on the pillow, mosquito net hanging like a veil. The floor felt more slanted than it had in the morning, though I knew that might be my imagination. I set my bag down and watched it settle, a tiny shift as it found its place in the tilt.

I sat on the edge of the bed and opened the book I'd bought. The essays were dense, full of words like *palimpsest* and *adaptive reuse*. It was the kind of reading I would have done for a seminar, the kind that makes you feel virtuous and vaguely bored. I read a paragraph about the “ethics of preservation” and thought about the hostel's waiver, the way it had framed risk as a quaint feature. I read another paragraph about “maintenance as an act of respect,” and thought about the strip of wood in the hallway.

Outside, the wind picked up. The shutters clacked. The building made a slow, complaining sound, a shift that I felt in my ribs. I glanced up at the beam. The crack along its edge looked the same. The dark knot in the wood looked like a watching eye. I told myself it was fine. I told myself I'd slept through worse storms. I told myself I was not nineteen and afraid.

June knocked on my door. “They’re making coffee,” she said. “And I heard there's a group going to a salsa class later, if you want to watch people pretend to have rhythm.”

“I’m good,” I said. “I think I’ll stay in.”

She leaned against the doorframe. “Because of the weather?”

“Because I’m tired,” I said. “And because I should actually read the thing I bought.” I held up the book, as proof of my own best intentions.

She looked at me for a long second. “Just text me if it gets weird,” she said.

“Define weird,” I echoed, and smiled.

“Define the building,” she said, and left.

I went to the courtyard for coffee anyway, because there are limits to my self-discipline. The coffee was stronger this time, the kind that wakes you without asking permission. Ana was there, scrolling through her phone with a frown.

“Storm warning,” she said, showing me the screen. “Tropical storm, possibly stronger tonight.”

I leaned in and read the advisory. It used the same exclamation points as before, the same graphic of a swirling red circle and a line toward the coast. I felt a twist in my stomach, small and manageable.

“People are leaving,” Ana said. “Some are going to a hotel.”

“Do you want to go?” I asked, because I could hear my mother in the question.

She shook her head. “It is expensive. I will stay in Seguro. It will be okay.”

I nodded, as if that settled it for me too. It did, for now.

By evening, the wind was a constant presence, pressing against the shutters, making the bougainvillea hiss. The sky went from gray to bruised purple. The courtyard lights came on early, casting a warm, jittery glow. I ate a bowl of rice and beans in the common room and listened to the other guests talk about their plans. A couple of Australians were debating whether to catch a late bus or wait it out. A German woman said she had stayed through a typhoon in Vietnam and it had been “fine,” which in hostel language is the highest form of reassurance. Someone said, “At least it’s not an earthquake,” and everyone laughed a little too loudly.

I went back to my room with my bowl and ate in bed, because I didn’t want to carry it upstairs again and because I wanted to pretend I was in control of where I was. The rain started as I finished, a soft hiss, then a steady drumming. The shutters rattled. The door swelled and stuck when I closed it, and I had to lift it slightly to get it to latch. The handle felt damp under my palm.

I set my bowl on the floor. The water in it trembled with each gust. I watched the surface ripple, a tiny storm in its own right. I kept watching until the ripples matched my breathing.

I checked my phone and saw that I'd posted three stories that day: the scaffolded wall, the mango, a photo of the courtyard with rain streaking through the light. The last one had gotten a reply from a classmate: *Looks dreamy!* I stared at it and felt a sudden, sharp annoyance. It did not look dreamy. It looked damp and old and a little bit tired, like me.

I set the phone face down. I opened my journal. My handwriting was wobbly from the humidity. I wrote: I am hiding behind the word authentic like it is armor. I crossed out armor and wrote excuse. That felt too honest, so I crossed that out too and wrote umbrella. I stared at the word and hated it. I left it anyway.

The wind made the shutters slap once, hard, and I flinched. The beam answered with a deeper creak than I'd heard before, a long, low sound that made my stomach go tight. Dust sifted down, a small sprinkle, landing on my book. I brushed it off and told myself it was normal. I told myself that old buildings shed like old skin. I told myself that a few grains of plaster were not a prophecy.

I lay down and pulled the mosquito net closed. The mesh hummed with the wind. The room smelled of wet wood and the faint rot of old walls. I could taste dust in the air, grit against my teeth. I wanted to check the weather again, to see if the storm had upgraded itself to something more official, but I didn't want to watch the map arrow inch closer. It felt like looking at a clock on a train you have already boarded.

The rain was heavier now, a steady roar, the sound of someone dumping handfuls of rice on the roof. The building shifted in small, slow ways. I felt it through the mattress, through my spine. I counted the seconds between gusts, the way you count between lightning and thunder, as if time could tell you how far away danger was.

At some point, the power flickered. The bare bulb in the room dimmed, brightened, dimmed again, then steadied. I closed my eyes. I imagined myself in a newer room, a sturdier bed, a different ceiling. I imagined waking up in the morning and feeling sheepish, not relieved. I imagined telling June and Ana that I'd moved, and hearing them say, “Finally.” I imagined telling my mother, and hearing the relief in her voice. I imagined telling myself, and hearing the disappointment.

The wind pushed hard against the shutters. The beam groaned, a sound like a door straining against its hinges. I opened my eyes and stared at the ceiling, at the pale web of cracks and the dark line along the beam. I could see the ceiling sag, just the slightest curve in the plaster, a gentle dip that might have always been there. Or might not have.

I told myself the building was old and the building was fine. I told myself I had chosen this and therefore it would hold. I told myself a story because I needed to believe it.

Outside, the storm cleared its throat and got louder.
